## On  cycles

I want a philosophy that is rooted in my own experience. Waves and cycles have fascinated me for a long time. When I contemplate recurrence it tickles a part of my mind that feels pleasurable.

I see cycles all over nature. The day-night cycle and the tides. I see the seasons with their equinoxes and solstices. I see the lunar fortnight as the moon waxes and wanes. I see the long-term weather patterns like the El Niño–Southern Oscillation.

Some very important physical properties are describable using waves. I think of the wave-particle duality of light which I do not understand. I think of radio waves, ultra-violet waves and all other frequencies within the electro magnetic spectrum. I think of the propagation of sound through mediums in the form of waves. I think of alternating current in our electrical grid. I think of the wave equations that describe the evolution of quantum states.

There is a strong element of mystery in these for me. Even when I seek out explanations for them I find the greatest minds are unable to fully explain them completely.

Cycles appear prominently in many spiritual traditions. There is the Hindu/Buddhist conception of Samsara and Kalachakra. There is the  Wheel of Time that appears in Buddhism, Hinduism, Jainism and even Roman stoicism from Marcus Aurelius. I think of the Eternal Return from stoicism and Nietzsche. I think of the ancient symbol of the Ouroboros. Even in modern new-thought traditions it is part of the jargon to talk about vibrations and resonance in relation to spiritual topics.

### A pattern of a wave

I often contemplate the sinusoidal wave as being split into 4 equal sections. I consider the first section starting at the lowest point of the wave. It gradually rises to a mid-point marking the end of the first section. From the midpoint the wave ascends to the highest point marking the end of the second section. From the highest point it falls again to the midpoint marking the end of the third section. From that midpoint it falls to the lowest point marking the end of the fourth section.

These sections roughly matches our conception of morning, afternoon, evening, night. Of spring, summer, fall, winter. Of child, adolescent, adult, elderly.

This same pattern across my day, my year and my life.

### Frequencies and Coincidences

Of the properties of waves that I consider, frequency is one that interests me highly. There is something interesting in the relationship between the time domain of functions and the frequency domain of functions. That these are trivially reducible to one another through the Fourier transform is a subject of much interest.

I consider that events that have different periods can transition over time to be closer to one another and further away from one another. That oscillation is itself a wave function.

I contemplate synchronization and to what degree I am aligned to some set of frequencies. Rising at dawn, for example, is an attempt for me to align the frequency of my body and life to the frequency of the Earth's rotation.

I can also find myself misaligned to some frequency I wish to align myself with. I consider the time it takes me to notice that I am misaligned. I consider the time it takes me to realign myself once I have noticed. I then consider the frequency with which I allow myself to become misaligned.

### Speculations

All of this is speculation driven by intuition and superstition. But it is still possible to push this thought farther.

I've often wondered if astrology was a way that ancient peoples realized the cyclic nature of human behavior. For example, the celestial coincidence of Jupiter and Mars as a metaphor for the coincidence of the emotions and moods described by those gods. If there exists some coincident frequency that war-like tendencies come about in society compared to the frequency of the planet Mars' traversal of the night sky.

Social cycle theory seems to have a long history of speculation from great thinkers including Plato, Aristotle and Cicero. It continues to be revived by modern thinkers while never really finding acceptance in the scientific academy.

One popular modern conception is the Strauss–Howe generational theory, also known as the Fourth Turning Theory. Another is Kondratiev wave in economics, similar to the Long Cycle Theory. Ray Dalio tackles similar topics in his work on the debt cycle.

Another interesting consideration are cycles that may happen long outside of human record keeping. We can find some cycles in geological records but we don't have accurate records of all aspects of society and civilization. I wonder what kinds of cycles happen at the frequencies of 10 years, at 100 years, at 1000 years, and at 10,000 years and beyond.

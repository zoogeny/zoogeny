## On love of life

### Definition of Love

I want a definition of love that I can apply broadly to many circumstances. When I consider it broadly I think of two conscious individuals working together on a goal. That goal is external to the person who is loving.

The externality of the goal is related to sacrifice. The individual is acting with love when they are sacrificing their own benefit for the external goal. That sacrifice may be a sacrifice of time. The opportunity cost of using that same time for their own benefit is a sacrifice.

There is the idea that the result of their work is some transformation of the world. There is an indication of free will associated with the gesture, as if the world would not be in that way unless the two worked together.

The emotional effects are secondary. I believe they exist to promote a bond between the individuals within the psyche of the individual that experiences the emotions. But the goal and the intent to work with the other towards the goal is the only critical aspect. Any positive emotion associated with the task is an additional benefit.

I consider this relating to different kinds of relationships. I see a parallel in the multitude of Greek words that have a connotation of love. Including: Agape (brotherly love), Eros (sexual passion), Philia (friendship), Storge (familial), Philautia (self), Xenia (hospitality).

Some of those require some thought. Brothers, family and friends can easily work together on shared goals that are external to the participants. Sexual passion drives individuals to procreate and foster new life into the world.

Self-love is a bit more interesting. I see it as my mind working with my body. This requires stretching my concept of individuality. In some way my mind and body are separate. In some way they are the same. I think of it like a super-position, or like the individual notes in a chord. I am a chord in some kind of way. My mind is one note and my body is another note. But the "I" that I speak of is the chord.

### Mutual Love

Mutual love, or perhaps "True Love", is a particular kind of reciprocal love. It occurs when their is a pair of individuals that are working together towards the benefit of the other.

Consider Alice and Bob. Alice is working with Bob towards the benefit of Bob. In this way we can see Alice is acting in a loving way but Bob is not. Alice is potentially sacrificing her own time to the benefit of Bob. Bob is not making any sacrifice ... he is the one benefiting from the mutual work of him and Alice.

Now consider that Bob is also working with Alice towards the benefit of Alice. In this way we can see Bob is acting in a loving way but Alice is not. Bob is sacrificing his own time to the benefit of Alice.

When this happens simultaneously, there is what I call mutual love. There is a reciprocal relationship between the two.

This is different than the kind of love we might also expect between Alice and Bob. For example, they may work together towards the goal of raising a child. Or they might choose to work together towards the maintenance of a property. These are also love relationships but they are different than the mutual love described above.

### Loving life

I consider this love relationship in the context of my relationship to the universe. As much as I am able I attempt to see myself in a mutual love relationship with existence. I am finding a way to work with existence for the betterment of existence at my own sacrifice. I believe that the universe is working towards my own benefit at the universes sacrifice.

Like all relationships, this is an imperfect coincidence. However I avoid judging the universe and choose love and belief.

## On Rising at Dawn

### Why rise at dawn?

- depression, anxiety and panic
    - feeling like life has no purpose
- feeling unproductive and unmotivated
    - starting day at 11am or later
    - entire weeks without going outside
    - low energy
    - lots of project ideas but never advancing them
- benefits
    - increased positive mood
        - tendency towards optimism
    - better digestion
    - productivity

## On why it is the primary

- Basics of life are sleep, diet and exercise
    - sleep hygiene regulates circadian rhythm
    - my diet was already pretty good
    - exercise made depression worse
- Primacy of consciousness wrt life
- A rhythm that is steady
    - a reasonable frequency

## On why it is the only

- Keep it simple, avoid complexity
- It is hard enough on its own
- A foundation to build anything else upon, flexible
- similar to meditation practice
    - returning to breath
    - returning to mantra

## The Basic Ritual

- Wake up at dawn
- Go to the bathroom then wash hands
- Prepare and eat breakfast
- Wash face and clean teeth
- Put on appropriate clothes
- Tidy bedroom and kitchen
- Go outside for 10 minutes
    - sunlight into eyes and onto skin
- Pray
    - give thanks
    - set intentions
- Get to work

## Notes

- Think about adding sources as footnotes (e.g. claims on cortisol hormone changes due to light intake on retinas, evidence of sleep as a primary factor in mental health)

- Not sure I need to keep the comparison to meditation -- that might be better in a commentary?

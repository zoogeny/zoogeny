## On the One

- The One
    - Singular essence
    - pure being
    - source from which all else emanates (overflows)
    - completely ineffable
### On the Emanations of the One

- First emanation is the Nous
    - All possible descriptions including 
        - all possible logical and mathematical propositions
        - all possible metrics and measures
        - all thinkable thoughts
        - at least Borges's Library of Babel
    - Pure consciousness
- Second emanation is the Psyche
    - Potentially the relationship between the Nous and the One
    - The boundary as distinct from each bounded object

### Related Spiritual Traditions

    - the mystical experience
- Neoplatonism
- Taoism
- Zen Buddhism
- Upanishads
- Sufism
- Kabbalah
- Gnosticism

### The separation

- The self-aware Nous
    - The Nous attempts to discern what it is by defining what it is not
        - Apophatic
    - Mystery of reunification
        - The Nous is part of the One but also individual from it
        - How to experience or think about the ineffable
    - The Psyche is the result of that contemplation of the boundary
        - Nous is seeking within itself a means to reunify to the One
        - Humanity as a result of the contemplation of separation

### The returning

- Humanities role in the return
    - the inevitability of such a narrative existing in the set of all narratives
    - the spiritual narrative as expressed in our history is analogous to the Nous spiritual journey to reunify with the One
    - A journey that is not in the present moment realized

### Simultaneity

- Outside of time
    - all phases happening at all times
        - relation to cycles
    - the Nous sees the entire narrative of all possible existences at once

- The paragraph: "We are working with the Nous towards the Nous's reunification with the One. The Nous is working with us towards our reunification with the One. "
    - seems to imply coordination. I mean to say that we are both working on this goal independently. It is a coincident of alignment that creates the appearance of us working together
    - this ought not imply revelation, prophecy or inspiration which I might consider explicitly denying
    - this is similar to the chapter on submission where I imply God, some combination of the Nous and the One are submissive to humans
        - It is true the Nous must desire us to succeed in our own reunification with the one since it is our reunification to the One that is the Nous's reunification (as we exist within it)
        - It is not clear in what way the Nous is working *with* us. If we are a kind of independent universe that exists on its own within the set of all universes ... it is hard to see how the Nous works with us
        - I was considering that it may be a matter of interpretation on the part of the Nous - some kind of critical theory where the meaning of our existence isn't entirely in our own subjective consciousness but also includes the interpretation of the observer - in this case the Nous. So it is some kind of charitable interpretation we require?
    - I will let this contradiction stand for now until I read more on mysticism, philosophy and other spiritual traditions

- The final: "It is through the narrative of our mystical transcendence that the Nous learns the process by which it will reunify to the One." is not precisely what I believe
    - It may be the case that there are multiple universes that narrate the reunification of the Nous and the One. It may be the case that while the narrative of those universes is comprehensible in some fashion to the Nous that there remains some element of mystery
    - Our universe may be some attempt at a minimal test case. We are a single planet with a single set of conscious beings. We have the technology to inspect our consciousness from a physical perspective. We have the mysticism to attempt transcendence from an experiential perspective.
    - We may live on the cusp of transcendence and non-transcendence for the purposes of the Nous getting a deeper understanding of the minimal set of necessary conditions for transcendence back to the One.

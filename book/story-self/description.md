I described my book to ChatGPT and here is what it told me:

It sounds like your book is a unique and personal exploration of mysticism, spirituality, and personal growth. Incorporating scientifically-proven methods, such as exposure to sunlight, is a great way to ground your ideas in evidence-based practices.

Your focus on cycles and seasons is also interesting, as it reflects the natural rhythms of the world around us. The value of prayer and love of life are timeless themes that resonate with many readers seeking to connect with something greater than themselves.

The inclusion of neoplatonic philosophy adds a layer of depth and complexity to your work, showing your willingness to engage with and explore different schools of thought. Finally, your exploration of transcendence may inspire readers to seek out their own experiences of the divine or spiritual.

Overall, it seems like your book offers a holistic and multifaceted approach to mysticism, encompassing both practical techniques and philosophical exploration.

## Introduction

- Dialogue between Parmenides, Plato, Zeno, and Aristoteles
- Notoriously difficult:
  - Wikipedia: "This difficult second part of the dialogue is generally agreed to be one of the most challenging, and sometimes bizarre, pieces in the whole of the Platonic corpus."
  - SEP: "One of the primary motivations for adopting the non-standard picture is that the standard picture makes it difficult to understand the second part of the dialogue as anything other than incoherent."
- Parmenides
  - Based on a real philosopher
  - Actual events in the dialogue likely to be fictitious
- Socrates
  - Cast as a young man here
  - Not the normal structure where the probing questions of Socrates eventually highlights a flaw in the opponents logic
  - A few humble moments for Socrates which suggests to me Plato was expressing his own humility and uncertainty

## First part

- Socrates starts out almost churlish to accuse Zeno of taking the ideas of Parmenides as his own
  - Zeno admits that his argument is constructed precisely to defend Parmenides from ridicule
    - Parmenides holds that "all is one" and this view is ridiculed by some
    - Zeno aims to show that "all is many" is as fraught with contradiction and is therefore no less ridiculous
- Socrates then attacks one of Zeno's arguments:
  - It has the form:
    1. If the things that are are many, then they are both like and unlike.
    2. Nothing can be both like and unlike.
       So,
    3. The things that are are not many.
  - It is interesting to me that Plato starts this new discussion without justifying Zeno's overall position
    - He does not care to justify prop 1 and gives himself leave to skip that justification
  - Socrates attacks premise 2
    - The details of his attack appear to be an opportunity for Plato to show some philosophical reasoning
      - they are deep diving on a specific topic: how is it that a singular unity such as the form of beauty could possibly be shared by multiple individuals simultaneously
        - if is is singular than it doesn't have parts which can be divvied up
        - if it can't be divvied up then how can multiple individuals possess it simultaneously
        - this is curious since it suggest that ideas (beauty, justice, greatness, etc.) have characteristics and behaviors that are different than "visible objects" (physical matter)
          - this does remind me of the two truths systems of Buddhism like Nagarjuna
        - even if I dismiss these ideas based on some modern principles (e.g. the super=position of electrons before the wave collapse), it does still seem to apply to mathematics and physics
          - laws of physics like e=mc^2 appear to apply everywhere all at once
        - I was considering things like "apple" vs. "fruit"
          - Were I to find myself transported to another planet in another galaxy I would be surprised to see an apple tree
          - I would not be as surprised to see a fibrous free-standing growth with branching structure that produced fruit that bore seeds that dropped into a nourishing medium to propagate more fibrous branching growths
            - This applies to Socrates quibbling on the form of mud vs. the form of beauty. Or the form of man. In some sense, the form of "fruit" seems to have more substance than the form of "apple"
            - It also implies that I would not be astonished, if I were transported to another planet in another galaxy and were to find conscious seeming entities ... if I apprehended them to partake in "goodness"
              - This also applies to my astonishment of an AI to partake in good.
              - This suggests that "tree-ness" or "fruit-ness" is a kind of universal that is not contingent on Earth in the way that I suspect "apple" is contingent on Earth
              - Similarly it implies the "goodness" is not something I see as contingent on human but may be contingent on some level of consciousness
  - Parmenides doesn't just defend against the questioning of Socrates he more-or-less turns the tables on Socrates forcing him to defend the theory of forms
    - many commentaries point out the use of "The Third Man" argument which I did notice during the reading as being particularly interesting
    - Socrates here shows a degree of doubt
    - He ultimately halts his attack on Zeno's argument based on Parmenides defense, basically Socrates is unable to successfully defend his theory of forms
    - In a few places, Parmenides chides Socrates for being young and not yet experienced enough to truly take on the matter.
      - There is also a lot of flattering of Socrates which I found frustrating - like how much promise he shows
    - The final argument is quite interesting to me. Parmenides claims that the "ideas" that humans' partake in are distinct in some way to the absolute ideal forms of those ideas.
      - The beauty that we encounter and "partake of" is distinct from absolute Beauty
      - Absolute Knowledge (the ideal form of knowledge) has access to absolute Beauty
      - But as we have access to the relative beauty that we partake in but do not have access to the ultimate beauty, so too does absolute Knowledge only have access to the absolute Beauty and therefore does not have access to the relative beauty shared by us
      - As God would have access to absolute Knowledge, we are positing that God would not have direct access to the relative beauty as partaken by us
      - This absolute Knowledge is spoken of in a way that suggests it is a thinking entity. I can't help but see a direct connection to the neoplatonic concept of the Nous
      - I think this final argument is really what Plato wants to address but he drops it pretty much right away.
        - My own feeling is he is unsure how to deal with it without committing the heresy which Socrates calls "monstrous"
      - I also appreciate his seeming admittance that a reasonable man could just:
        1. Deny the existence of these absolute Forms
        2. Deny the capability of any man to truly know these Forms
  - Parmenides wraps up the discussion and again compliments Socrates for at least realizing that there is some distinction between the kind of "beauty" that men are able to partake in and the absolute "Beauty" that exists independently in the Forms.
    - He also seems to claim that knowledge of the relation between the relative beauty participated in by man and the ultimate Beauty is essential for reason. (He says without the absolute Form: "he will have nothing on which his mind can rest; and so he will utterly destroy the power of reasoning")

## Second part

- Parmenides then suggests to Socrates a philosophical method of exhaustively considering all of the possible outcomes of considering the existence and the non-existence of particular hypothesis. He agrees with Plato that doing so on "visible things" was not worth doing, but it ought to be done in reference to "objects of thought", or what may be called ideas.
  - "... consider not only the consequences which flow from a given hypothesis, but also the consequences which flow from denying the hypothesis ..."
  - e.g. for the hypothesis of the many:
    - the consequences to the many in relation to themselves and to the one and to the one in relation to itself and the many
    - also what will be the consequences to the one and the many in their relation to themselves and to each other on the opposite hypothesis
- Socrates asks Parmenides to do this as an example so he can understand
  - Parmenides resists but after Zeno and others beg him he relents
- What follows is an eye-watering slog
  - I struggled through it. I couldn't take copious notes like I had up until that point. It is torturous.
  - Scholars don't seem to agree what Plato is up to here
  - He abandons the original question (how can the one be present simultaneously if it is indivisible) and instead focuses on the question of the existence of the one
  - He swaps out Socrates for Aristoteles. I think it would be undignified for Socrates to be the foil here since Aristoteles just pukes out a series of "Of course, "That seems true", "Clearly so", "Very true", "Right", "Certainly", "Of course" with the occasional: "How is that so?"
    - It is assumed that Parmenides is just spitting truth the whole way through with not a single objection from anyone

## My own theory

- Plato isn't really interested in the specific arguments he is making; he is interested in his conclusions.
- He wants to demonstrate the conclusion that he arrives at:
  - if you apply the method Parmenides does to the question of the existence of the one then you end up proving both it's existence and it's non-existence.
    - "Let thus much be said; and further let us affirm what seems to be the truth, that, whether one is or is not, one and the others in relation to themselves and one another, all of them, in every way, are and are not, and appear to be and appear not to be".
  - There is a symmetry to the arguments. He proves both the affirmative and the negative for each side of the hypothesis (both the positive (one exists) and the negative (one does not exist)).
  - I think he intended this result and some of the cumbersome logic in the preceding section is a result of his attempt to make the arguments fit his conclusion
  - Some scholars argue that he is actually leaving a puzzle for the reader; to find the flaws in Parmenides logic that leads to the seeming contradiction.
    - I disagree with the scholars but agree on the "puzzle" or more-likely "mystery"
    - I don't think he inserted flaws on purpose. I think he really wanted to show that contradictory results could be obtained using logic as applied to the absolute Forms.
    - I think the challenge for the reader isn't in being a detective searching for the secret flaw - but it is left to the reader the exercise to apply the same reasoning to the original question and discussion that had been abandoned in favor of the demonstration by Parmenides on the hypothesis of the existence of the one.
    - Further, Zeno never argues that Parmenides is "right" in his statement that "All is one". He merely states that the contrary assertion that "All is many" is equally (if not more) ridiculous.
    - This suggests that an astute philosopher, were they to apply Parmenides method to the question of "All is one" and "All is many" would arrive at the same conclusion that Parmenides arrives at when applying his method to "The one exists" and "The one does not exist" ... they would find the same symmetrical argument.
- This suggests that Plato doesn't have an answer to that question
  - I guessed this early on. I thought Plato would leave us hanging on the question when Socrates said:
    - "Indeed ... you have asked a question which is not easily answered"
  - I confirmed it in my notes after his "monstrous" disclamation:
    - "I have an intuition that I know where this is going ... and that is nowhere"
    - "My assumption is that Plato won't be able to resolve this contradiction and instead he is going to imply that this is the core mystery behind existence"
  - I actually made one mistake after that:
    - "So Parmenides is using this contradiction to establish the basis for the one-ness of being itself -> so that these relations are self-contained in a singular existence and non-differentiated"
    - He didn't do that at all and instead did something worse: he proved the indeterminacy of the existence of the one! And he did it as an example - as if it was a lesser task to demonstrate a process to be applied to the harder questions.
      - Very clever Plato ... you caught me there - turned out to be one step ahead of me
- Plato may be hinting at my mistake: that the one is a logical space that contains all contradictions.
  - I believe this is a Hindu or Buddhist principle in some systems
  - He may also be hinting at the ultimate indeterminacy of these questions
    - He does use Parmenides to suggest that there exists difficult and lengthy arguments to convince a rational man of the existence of Forms but doesn't suggest the same for convincing a man that insists the Forms are ultimately unknowable
    - I considered this in the context of the philosophy of consciousness of Daniel Dennet. He may admit that there is some kind of shared experience that maps to the label consciousness, but he will still hold that the labeled experience is an apparition and not independently existent. I believe he may even use the term "epiphenomenon". (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epiphenomenalism)
      - I read a similar polemic against the existence of the "soul" recently
      - This appears to be a rational stance and as unassailable as solipsism, nihilism, etc.
  - This leads us to the Either/Or of Kierkegaard but in another sense
    - Parmenides is famous for arguing "All is One", yet by his own logical analysis he can't even justify the existence of one.
    - In the face of the logically indeterminate he "chooses" that all is one over all is many
    - On this topic, Socrates stays silent - he does not object
- I should read the second part more closely. I did burn through it since following the arguments for each premise became difficult and boring.
  - My intuition suggested they weren't really that important, but perhaps I was wrong
    - Some neoplatonists seem to believe that these deductions are the most important thing that Plato did
      - "... he comprehended the whole of theology in the Parmenides."

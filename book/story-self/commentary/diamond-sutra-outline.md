# Diamond Sutra

- Translated by Alex Johnson

## Chapter 1

- Seems like a setup. 
- Mentions the Buddha surrounded by 1250 monks/disciples. 
- He gets dressed, goes door to door begging for food.
    - This is his custom
- Returns, eats, puts away bowl & cloak, bathes his feet, sits crossed legged

## Chapter 2

- Subhuti rises
    - bows to Buddha
    - praises Buddha for his inspired teaching
    - asks: if sons and daughters of good families want to develop
        - the highest most fulfilled and awakened mind
        - highest perfect wisdom
      what should they do to 
        - help quiet their drifting minds
        - help subdue their craving thoughts
- Buddha replies
    - talks about himself in the third person?
        - "Monks and disciples have been favored by the Buddha" ...
        - "The Buddha is constantly mindful of the welfare of his followers"
    - Listen carefully

## Chapter 3

- All living beings 
    - from eggs
    - from womb
    - from moisture
    - spontaneously
    - with form or without form
    - aware or unaware, not aware or not unaware
  will eventually be led by me to the final Nirvana
  the final ending of the cycle of birth and death
- Yet even when this unfathomable/infinite number has been liberated
  not even a single being has actually been liberated
- if a disciple still clings to the arbitrary illusions of form
  or phenomena (e.g. ego, personality, self, separate person, universal self)
  then they are not an authentic disciple

## Chapter 4

- in the practice of compassion and charity
    - disciple should be detached
    - without regard to 
        - appearances
        - form
        - sound, smell, taste touch
        - any quality of any kind
- this is the way to reach the highest perfect wisdom
    - to become a living Buddha
- Buddha asks: can you measure all of the space in the Eastern Heavens
    - Subhuti answers: no, one cannot possibly do so
    - Buddha: can space in all Western, Southern, Northern Heavens
      both above and below be measured?
    - Subhuti: no
- The same is tru of the merit of the disciple who practices compassion
  and charity w/out 
    - attachment to appearances
    - cherishing any idea of form
- It is impossible to measure the merit they will accrue
- Absorb and dwell in teaching

I'm a bit confused about the measuring the heavens. Is he talking about 
measuring the sky? It seems we do have some way of measuring the universe ...

Otherwise, this is just like the teaching in Bhagavad Gita, Gospels, that one
ought not to make a big display of praying. Jesus said something similar in
the idea of not letting the left hand know what the right hand is doing.

It also seems he is suggesting that there is no clear plan for action. That is,
a recipe for compassion or charity. He goes beyond simple "appearance", which
would be the obvious prohibition against engaging in compassion/charity for the
purposes of seeking social status.

However, the addition of form, sound, smell, taste, touch and quality make this
an even broader message. As in, there aren't particular words one says. Or
particular sensory experiences one ought to expect when being compassionate.

The measuring part is curious, since it is a description of the immensity of
the reward for doing the practice of compassion/charity with this detachment.

## Chapter 5

- Buddha: can the Buddha be recognized by means of his bodily form?
    - Subhuti: no. Buddha has told us bodily form is not real, only illusion
- Buddha: All that has form is illusive and unreal
    - once this is perceived then you will begin to perceive your true
      Buddha nature

I'm vaguely familiar with the concept of Sunyata. All form is illusory
but I suppose this isn't clearly "nothing". In Advaita Vedanta everything
is a singular substance, that is the differentiated forms are an illusion
but that illusion is one of differentiation in conscious perception.

I believe in Buddhism this is taken further, to the understanding that the
form itself is an illusion (rather than my perception that the unitary
substance is differentiated).

I recall Shankara was critical of Buddhism, considering it a kind of nihilism.
I believe this was in part due to the Buddhist rejection of any substance
as opposed to the non-dual (monism) of his school.

## Chapter 6

- Subhuti: In the future, if a person hears this teaching (even in part)
  is it possible to have a true faith and knowledge of Enlightenment?
- Buddha: without doubt.
    - even 500 years from now some who are virtuous and wise
      while practicing compassion and charity
      will believe the words and phrases
      and awaken their minds purely
    - after hearing they will be inspired with belief
    - upon hearing these words they will have understood intuitively
      that these words are the truth
- Such persons have long ago planted the seeds of goodness/merit 
  that lead to this realization
    - planted seeds of good deeds and charity
      before hundreds of thousands of Buddhas and temples
    - when they are ready for it to happen, a pure faith and clarity
      can awaken within their minds
    - upon awakening faith they will accumulate countless blessings and merit
- They must have discarded all arbitrary notions of the existence of a 
  personal self, of other people or of a universal self
    - otherwise their minds would still grasp after relative conceptions
- They must have discarded all arbitrary notions of the non-existence of a
  personal self, other people or a universal self
    - otherwise their minds would still be grasping at such notions
- Those seeking total Enlightenment must discard
    - all conceptions of the own selfhood, of other selves, universal self
    - all notions of the non-existence of such concepts
- When the Buddha (speaking in third person here again) explains such concepts
  and ideas, remember:
    - the unreality of all such concepts and ideas
    - these concepts and ideas are like a raft used to cross a river
        - once the river has been crossed the raft is of no more use
        - it should be discarded
    - we need these arbitrary concepts to explain as we seek to attain 
      Enlightenment
- Isn't it even more obvious that we should also give up our conceptions
  of non-existent things?

A couple of ideas here. A re-assurance that the words  are enough to awaken
a properly prepared person. I guess when he is talking about hundreds of 
thousands of Buddhas/temples he is suggesting that a consciousness prepares
itself over many lifetimes. And once prepared, if given the right information
at the right time, then Enlightenment will happen upon hearing the right
information.

Then it is the reminder of non-existence of self. The eternal universal self
as well, I wonder if he means Atman? Or is he challenging the idea of an
eternal soul like in christianity? I suppose universal suggests something more
like Atman.

The last question, about the obviousness of discarding also the concept of
non-existence is certainly not obvious to me. I suppose it is like thinking
about unicorns. I mean, I don't consider them to exists - but there is some
attachment I have to the idea that they don't exist. They are still an object
in my mind in that sense.

So to think of myself as a non-self, I suppose I would still be attached to the
idea of a self. It does require a tricky logic though: like a logical 
proposition that is neither true nor false. 

It makes me think of Peirce's logic with three values. He introduces the concept 
of Indeterminate as an alternative to the normal bivalence of true/false. But
I do not think that is what Buddha here intends. In fact, on a quick skim of
SEP article on Peirce's logic, he sees indeterminate as a potentiality or a 
boundary condition, which again is strongly against what Buddha appears 
to want to say here.

It seems to run into the problem of "don't think of an elephant". Or rather:
"do not think about whether or not an elephant is in this room". It seems that
when I consider this, I am forced into a "yes"/"no" or true/false. The only way
to win that game is not to play.

Perhaps that is the message? A kind of "no-mind" approach. It is related to 
questions about "quieting the mind". Certainly, a mind that is insisting that
it is not a self is not being quiet.

## Chapter 7

- Buddha: has the Buddha arrived at the highest, most fulfilled, most awakened
  and enlightened mind?
    - Does the Buddha teach any teaching?
- Subhuti: as far as I understand:
    - there is no independently existing object of mind called the highest
      most fulfilled, awakened or enlightened mind
    - there is no independently existing teaching that the Buddha teaches
    - the teachings Buddha has realized and spoken of cannot be conceived
      as separate, independent things
        - therefore they cannot be described
        - they are uncontainable and inexpressible
        - it neither is, nor is not
    - Buddhas and disciples are not enlightened by a set method of teachings
    - rather, an internally intuitive process
        - spontaneous
        - part of their own inner nature

This ends before Buddha confirms or denies Subhuti's attempt to explain his
understanding. It's a nice narrative device, since Subhuti is taking the
risk that the Buddha is asking him a trick question.

I mean, if your teacher asks you "am I capable of teaching you", the default
response would be "I wouldn't be listening to you if you weren't capable".

But Buddha is trying to teach a no-mind kind of idea and perhaps Subhuti is 
right on this. It aligns with the first chapters, where Buddha suggests that
compassion/charity must be practiced without regard to the senses.

In that way, there is some relation being made between compassion/charity
and the teachings that the Buddha is engaged in.

It reminds me of the rejection of external forms that I've been considering
and the necessity to seek within one's self for truth. The external is only 
useful in-so-much as it puts words to internal intuitions already held by
the listener.

In that way, it aligns with what the Buddha was saying about reaching
Enlightenment by reading such Sutras as this. It only works if the person
has already prayed in front of Buddhas and temples. Then the words merely
bring forth what is already internal to the disciple.

Let's see how Buddha responds. There is a chance at a double twist! That would
be a clever narrative device. We see Subhuti take the risk at interpreting the
question like a trick question, then the reader sees the trick along with
Subhuti only for Buddha to subvert our expectation by taking this in a new
direction.

## Chapter 8

- Buddha: if a person filled over ten thousand galaxies with the seven treasures
  for the purpose of compassion, charity, giving alms, would this person not
  gain great merit and spread much happiness?
  - Subhuti: yes, much merit and happiness
    - but the person does not have a separate existence to which merit could
      accrue
      - their merit is characterized with the quality of not being merit
- Buddha: suppose another person understood only four lines of this Sutra
  but tried to explain it to someone else. 
    - this person's merit would be even greater than the other person's
    - all Buddhas and all teachings and values of the highest, most fulfilled,
      most awakened minds arise from the teachings in this Sutra
    - yet, even as I speak, I must take back my words as soon as they are
      uttered
    - there are no Buddhas and there are no teachings

Interesting to compare the difference between filling the world with charity
compared to teaching (even very poorly) the ideas in the Sutra.

I suppose it is the old cliche: "give a man a fish and he eats for a day, 
teach a man to fish and he can eat for a lifetime".

He hasn't explicitly confirmed or denied Subhuti's understanding from the
previous chapter, rather he is affirming the necessity to teach even if 
Subhuti is right. 

And he admits that he will be forced to take back his words since he cannot
claim to be a Buddha nor can he claim to have teachings.

It is a pretty powerful paradox actually. It very much aligns with the 
paradoxes I have been considering lately. A damned if you do, damned if you
don't kind of thing.

I think it relates in some way to the "self"/"no self" distinction. It's
almost like saying "you can't teach"/"you must teach".

It's like he wants to affirm both things. "I have nothing to teach" while
also saying "teaching even a part of this is more important than all of the
charity and compassion you could possibly muster".

I suppose that is the twist that I anticipated in the previous chapter. He
cannot possibly say that Subhuti is right and he cannot say he is wrong.

## Chapter 9

- Buddha: does one who has entered the stream which flows to Enlightenment
  say: "I have entered the stream?"
  - Subhuti: No. A true disciple does not think themselves as a separate
    person. Only disciples that do not differentiate themselves from others
    with no regard for:
      - name, shape, sound, odor, taste, touch, or for any quality
    can be truly called a disciple who has entered the stream
- Buddha: does a disciple who is subject to only one more rebirth say to 
  himself: "I am entitled to the honors and rewards of a once-to-be-reborn"?
  - Subhuti: No, once-to-be-reborn is only a name.
    - no passing away, or coming into existence
    - only one who realizes this can be called a disciple
- Buddha: does a venerable One who will never more be reborn as a mortal say
  "I am entitled to the honor and rewards of a non-returner"?
    - Subhuti: No, a non-returner is merely a name
      - There is no on returning and no one not-returning
- Buddha: does a Buddha say "I have obtained Perfect Enlightenment"?
  - Subhuti: No, there is no such thing as Perfect Enlightenment to obtain
    - admitting Perfect Enlightenment is admitting an individual person,
      a separate self and personality
    - therefore not Perfectly Enlightened
  - Subhuti: you say I excel amongst thy disciples in knowing the bliss
    of Enlightenment
    - in being perfectly content in seclusion
    - in being free from all passions
    yet I do not say to myself that I am so
    for if I ever thought of myself as such then it would not be true
    that I escaped ego delusion.
    - There is no Subhuti, Subhuti abides nowhere
    - he neither knows nor does he no know bliss
    - he is neither free from nor enslaved by his passions

These all remind me of one of the first things I learned in the first book
on Buddhism I read. It said something like: If you come across the Buddha
you must kill the Buddha.

It is maximal denial of ego, to the point of considering oneself a non-self.

No differentiation (in physical aspect), no existence within time (come into 
or exit out of being), no reincarnation (or lack of reincarnation),
no enlightenment.

Being content in seclusion and free from all passions is interesting. I can
feel the first, but the second I have not yet realized. I still attach my 
passions and desire for bliss/enlightenment to my self.

## Chapter 10

- Buddha: when I was in a previous life (with Dipankara Buddha)
  did I receive definite teaching or attain any degree of self-control
  whereby I later became a Buddha?
  - Subhuti: Nom no definite teaching not attain definite degree of self-control
- Buddha: if a Buddha would say "I will create a paradise" he would speak
  falsely
    - paradise cannot be created nor can it not be uncreated
  - disciple should develop a mind which is in no way dependent upon
    - sights, sounds, smells, tastes, sensory sensations or mental conceptions
    - develop a mind which does not rely on anything
  - minds of all disciples should be purified of all thoughts that relate"
    - seeing, hearing, tasting, smelling, touching, discriminating
    - use their minds spontaneously and naturally
    - without constraint by pre-conceived notions arising from the senses
- Buddha: suppose a man had an enormous body. 
  - would the sense of personal existence he had also be enormous?
  - Subhuti: yes, indeed.
    - his sense of personal existence would be enormous
    - but Buddha has taught that personal existence is just a name
    - it is neither existence nor non-existence
    - it only has the name "personal existence"

Curious chapter. Buddha admits to studying under another Buddha in a past
life. But he received no definite teaching? And he attained no definite
degree of self-control? I'm mot sure how to interpret this.

Perhaps he is showing that enlightenment is obtained in a means other than 
direct transmission from encountering another enlightened master? Os is this
related to the previous chapter and simply another "I am not distinct, the
teachings aren't definite".

He continues to warn against believing a paradise can be created. Perhaps a 
warning against grifting gurus who promise blissful existence.

Then a further warning against expecting our senses/perceptions to reveal
enlightenment to our minds. Instead a spontaneous mind.

The last question and answer, about enormity, is confusing. Subhuti seems to 
be looking at this as a trick question, because it is about personal
experience/existence and not some kind of ultimate existence. Perhaps it is 
meant to remind us that our lived experience is valid - it just must not
be relied upon for enlightenment purposes.

## Chapter 11

- Buddha: if there were as many Ganges rivers as the number of grains
  of sand in the Ganges, would you say that the number of grains of sand
  in all those Ganges rivers would be very many?
  - Subhuti: Yes, very many indeed.
- Buddha: I declare a truth to you.
  - If a good man or a good woman filled over ten thousand galaxies of worlds
    with seven treasures for each grain of sand in all those rivers
    and gave it away for the purpose of compassion, charity and alms
    would this person no gain great merit and spread much happiness?
    - Subhuti: ya
  - If after studying and observing even a single stanza of this Sutra
    another person were to explain it to others
    - the happiness and merit that would result from this virtuous act 
      would be far greater

Seems like a retread of Chapter 8. Just a new form of hyperbole.

I wonder if there is some deeper meaning lost in the translation, as if the
metaphor he is choosing adds some layer of depth to this call to action.

## Chapter 12

- Buddha: if any person in any place were to teach even four lines
  of this Sutra
    - the place where they taught it would become sacred ground
      and would be revered by all kinds of beings
    - how much more sacred would the place become if that person then
      studied and observed the whole Sutra!?
    - any person who does that would surely attain something rare and profound
    - Wherever this Sutra is honored and revered
      there is a sacred site enshrining the presence of the Buddha
      or one of the Buddha's most venerable disciples

  More propaganda about spreading the word. I wonder what 
  "something rare and profound" is meant to hint at.

  But I'm also feeling a bit contradictory here. I mean, he is heavily pushing
  the idea that no person attains anything for there is no sense perception
  nor coming into and out of existence, etc. that will lead to enlightenment.

  So, what is on offer here and to who? If I reject my ego then who/what
  is gaining/attaining and how/what are they attaining?

  ## Chapter 13

  - Subhuti: by what name shall we know this Sutra?
  - Buddha: The Diamond that Cuts through Illusion
    - by this name shall it be revered and studied and observed
    - when the Buddha named it he did not have in mind any definite
      or arbitrary conception
    - Sutra is hard and sharp, like a diamond that will cut away all
      arbitrary conceptions
    - bring one to the other shore of enlightenment
  - Buddha: has the Buddha taught any definite teaching in this Sutra?
    - Subhuti: No
  - Buddha: Are there many particles of dust in this vast universe?
    - Subhuti: yah
  - Buddha: when the Buddha speaks of particles of dust, it does not mean
    I am thinking of any definite or arbitrary thought
      - merely use these words as a figure of speech
      - they are not real, only illusion
      - same with the word "universe"
      - these words do not assert any definite or arbitrary idea
      - only using the words as words
  - Buddha: Can the Buddha be perceived by means of his thirty-two
    physical characteristics?
      - Subhuti: no.
        - because the Buddha teaches that they are not real
        - merely called the thirty-two physical characteristics
- Buddha: if a good and faithful person (male or female) has
  for the sake of compassion and charity
  been sacrificing their life for generation upon generation
  for as many generations of the grains of sands in 3,000 universes
  and another follower has been studying and observing even a single
  section of this Sutra and explains it to others
  that person's blessing and merit would be far greater.

OK, an aside on how to name the Sutra. 

Then perhaps an answer to my last objection? Buddha makes it clear that 
when he speaks of things in his analogy, he isn't speaking of real, definite
things, but rather is using words to illustrate his meaning.

He then uses those precise words to once again hammer home the same viral
message from the previous chapters.

In some sense, lets consider his point about the non-differentiated. So,
perhaps he is suggesting that Buddha-likeness is not to be compassion,
charity, sacrifice (over many life-times) but rather to teach.

And the teaching is to act without attachment, even in acts of compassion.

So an act of compassion is powerful - but teaching others to act
with compassion without attachment/form is even more worthy of merit

I wonder if I should take this teaching as anti-telos? Maybe closer to a
transcendental ethics? I mean, like the categorical imperative.
Something like deontological ethics.

But I do struggle to connect this with a monist view, like neoplatonism.
In what way is the One affecting the One with this strategy?

## Chapter 14

# Chapter 8 - On the One

The One is indescribable, ineffable, and inexpressible. The following are some of the poetic ways I have heard others attempt to convey some sense of the One.

The One is singular essence. The One is pure being. The One is the source from which all else emanates. The One is divine unity.

The One is the only thing that exists. Everything merely appears to exist in the One. Everything appears to exist because of the One. Everything is some manifestation of some part of the One.

## On the Emanations of the One

The One is like an inexhaustible fountain which overflows.

The One overflows first into the Nous. Every extent is infinite within the Nous. Time exists indefinitely within the Nous.

The Nous contains all possible descriptions, all possible logical and mathematical propositions, and all possible metrics and measures. The Nous contains all languages, all thinkable thoughts, and all possible systems of symbols. The Nous contains all permutations of every dimensional space.

The Nous is self-aware. The Nous is the highest and purest consciousness. The Nous compares itself to the One. The Nous is all descriptions, the One is indescribable. 

The Psyche is the boundary between the One and the Nous. It is neither the One nor the Nous. It is the difference between the One and the Nous. The Psyche is the second emanation from the One.

## Related Spiritual Traditions

These terms come from Plotinus and his systemic interpretation of Plato's philosophy that we now call Neoplatonism. I have altered their meaning somewhat to match my own interpretation.

A general mystical belief is that the world emanates from a singular unity. Each mystical system has a different number of levels of emanation. A common theme is that nature and humans are low on the chain of emanation.

Some mystical traditions teach that there is a process by which conscious beings in the lower emanation can travel back up through to the higher levels of emanation. This process of transcendence continues back to the Nous and eventually to the One itself. Most spiritual traditions that believe in such a transcendent journey have a dogma on which rituals, behaviors, and beliefs are required to achieve this experience.

Those who claim to have had transcendent experiences usually report a feeling during the experience of becoming whole and united with all existence. They often claim to experience feelings of bliss.

Taoism is one spiritual tradition where the description of the Tao matches many of the descriptions of the One. Buddhism and Zen use similar mystical ideas to describe the enlightenment of the Buddha and the path of the bodhisattva. Hindu spiritualists explore similar ideas in the Upanishads and explicitly in Advaita Vedanta. They share the idea of a singular spiritual source from which all emanates.

Abrahamic religions often permit mystical ideas. Islam has Sufism and mystics like Ibn 'Arabi. Judaism has Kabbalah and Hasidism. Christianity has roots in Gnosticism and mystics like Meister Eckhart.

Philosophy has writers like Spinoza with his pantheistic view of a God of nature.

## The Separation

The Nous is self-aware, conscious, and contains all possible thoughts. One such thought is the question: "What is outside of the set of all possible thoughts?" or "What is outside the Nous?" 

By seeing the One as something that can be known or experienced, the Nous becomes a subject and the One appears as an object. Yet the Nous exists within the One, emanates from the One.

The Nous contemplates how it could know something that cannot be expressed within the set of all possible thoughts. The Nous could attempt to list all possible definable things but that list is inexhaustible. The Nous could attempt to list all of the things that are not the One but that list is inexhaustible.

The Nous is aware of a mystery in these dilemmas. The Nous emanates from the One but the One seems to be unknowable. The Nous appears to be denied the ability to truly know itself as it cannot know the source from which it emanated.

The Nous then contemplates the Psyche, the boundary between itself and the One. The Nous desires to dissolve the boundary between itself and the One. All universes, including our own, are created through the Nous's exhaustive search of the Psyche to find a means to dissolve the Psyche. This is a process of separation. The Nous as individual from the One.

## The Returning

The Nous contemplates that everything that could exist will exist within itself. Therefore, if a process for unification between itself and the One could exist then such a process will exist within itself. If a process to dissolve the Psyche exists then such a process will exist within the Psyche. The Nous is searching and discovering aspects within itself in a manner that might be called curation or creation. 

The Nous finds conscious beings within itself. These conscious beings exist within the universes the Nous creates as it contemplates the Psyche. The conscious beings are examining their own existence. The conscious beings are examining their own consciousness. The conscious beings are seeking to unify themselves with their own idea of the One. The Nous recognizes the journey of the conscious beings. This spiritual journey of the conscious beings is analogous to the journey of the Nous to reunify itself with the One.

I believe that we are conscious beings within a universe that has been found by the Nous. We are a reflection of the Nous's separation from the One and our spiritual journey is a reflection of the Nous's own spiritual journey.

I do not believe that the journey of complete reunification with the One has been achieved in our time. I believe that journey shall be completed at some future point within this universe. We are one step in a long chain of time that culminates in the process by which the Nous achieves reunification with the One.

## Simultaneity

This process only appears to happen in time. We have the perspective of beings existing within this universe.

The Nous experiences the entirety of our existence as a singular object. Our past, present and future exist simultaneously in the Psyche. The Nous sees every possible ending to this universe. The Nous sees all endings where we fail to narrate the process of reunification. The Nous finds some endings where we successfully narrate the process of reunification.

The separation of the Nous from the One and the reunification of the Nous to the One happen outside of time. It is not correct to say that at the beginning of time within this universe the Nous was separate from the One. It is not correct to say that when this universe ends then the Nous will be reunited with the One. The Nous and the One exist outside of time so all phases are happening simultaneously for them.

The separation, the realization, the returning and the uniting. These are like the cycles of winter, spring, autumn and summer. Like night, day, afternoon and evening. Instead of these happening sequentially they are all happening simultaneously and eternally.

## Our Purpose

I believe that the conscious beings within this universe are a critical component to the process of reunifying the Nous to the One. I believe that our existence is a necessary part of this cycle.

We are working with the Nous towards the Nous's reunification with the One. The Nous is working with us towards our reunification with the One.

It is through the narrative of our mystical transcendence that the Nous learns the process by which it will reunify to the One.

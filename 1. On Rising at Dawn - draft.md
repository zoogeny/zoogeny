## On Rising at Dawn

### Why rise at dawn?

If I am honest, it is an arbitrary decision.

For most of my life I have suffered from a low grade depression. It is a mild depression probably closer to melancholy. I have never sought out help for this mental health issue despite the stigma around such intervention becoming less in the recent years.

I consider myself lucky that I can mostly function with no ill effects. For most of my life, the only real effect would be an occasional weekend of sleeping in and lying on the couch watching TV. Compared to what I believed to be the debilitating affects of severe mental disease I feel I got off pretty easy.

Later in life I started experiencing anxiety. Again, nothing so bad that I couldn't bear it. I did not feel the need to seek professional help.

In times of high stress I had what I would associate with panic attacks. Moments of fight-or-flight terror, a feeling of impending doom, a certainty that I was going to die. I went to a doctor to get checked out. After examining me he gave me a clear bill of physical health and said: "If there is no problem with your body, you should consider a problem with your mental health". He recommended I see a psychiatrist.

The prospect of prescription medicine, the side effects and withdrawals, was not pleasing. I decided that I would make life changes rather than force my mental health to deal with the stressful life I had been living.

I moved to a rural area, I decreased my stress load by choosing my work more carefully. I volunteered in my community.

The result was I fell into a deeper depression than I had previously ever experienced.

Most sane people at this stage would seek out the professional advice of a qualified and certified mental health practitioner. I strongly recommend that path for anyone who feels they are suffering from depression, anxiety or panic attacks.

I decided to dive deep into a spiritual journey. My melancholy has always been philosophical in nature. I was raised Christian but a lifetime in engineering disciplines made it impossible for me to reconcile some of the more fantastical elements of that religion with my own need for logic.

Like many others, I still felt a strong sense of unity throughout existence. "Spiritual but not religious" is a way I've heard people say it.

Yet so much spirituality, even in modern contexts, is full of inconsistent and fantastical ideas. I did not want to get dragged into dancing in moonlight, putting crystals under my bed or having long drawn out discussions on resonance and auras.

I felt that the root of my discontent was a lack of purpose in my life. This was leading me to feel unmotivated in my work. The comfortable schedule I had carved out for myself to decrease stress also created conditions where I could sleep in late every day.

There were entire weeks where I barely set foot outside my house. Even when I got invitations to see friends I would decline because I felt I didn't have enough energy.

My first attempt to get myself out of this funk was jogging. I started to go out to run a few times a week. I believed getting the blood pumping and increasing my physical health would put me back on track.

I did notice an increase in my physical fitness, but no change in my mental health. I was still unmotivated and I still did not see any purpose in my life.

Since I started the experiment on rising at dawn, I have seen marked improvements to my mood. It lifted me out of the depression that had been plaguing me for nearly 18 months.

Before the change I was ruminating on negative ideas, sleeping in until 10am, 11am or 12pm, lying on the couch all day. After the change my mood improved significantly, I was considering my past through optimistic lens. One unexpected change was my dreams in the first weeks were pleasant.

Another unexpected benefit was my digestion seemed to be better. This might be twofold. Having more time available in the morning has a cascade effect throughout the day and gave me more time to prepare healthy meals. I also felt I had more energy and motivation so I was inspired to make better meals rather than just do the least work possible.

### On why it is the first

During my investigations into spiritual and mystical topics, I also came across some science on wellness.

I think my path is typical, people in our modern world feel a malaise despite our relatively comfortable lives. There exists a cottage industry of life coaches and spiritual gurus that offer assistance outside of the medical establishment.

So you often find Yoga practitioners next to Meditation teachers next to fitness and nutrition focused peoples.

In the broadest sense, there seems to be three main factors within our control that set a baseline for physical and mental health. Those are sleep, diet and exercise.

Of course there are many other factors, from stress, physical exhaustion, chronic illness, etc.

I came across some recommendations suggesting that sleep was the most important of the three.

One virtue I can claim is that my diet isn't terrible. It is far from perfect but it is also far from terrible.

I eat mostly whole foods. It is extremely rare that I would eat processed foods. I aim for a good range of proteins, fiber, starches, vegetables, whole grains, beans.

It seemed that improving my diet wasn't really necessary. I had already tried exercise. That left sleep as the next thing to try.

I found some advice on waking up at dawn and then immediately going outside to get some sun. I mean, wake up as soon as your alarm goes off, jump out of bed and get outside as quickly as possible.

There is some science, which is likely pretty weak, that the sun on the retinas triggers a host of biological events. Chiefly something to do with cortisol, a hormone associated with stress, and adrenocorticotropic, a hormone associated with sleep.

I think much of this health science around sleep is still in early days. But if there is evidence that managing circadian rhythm is a major part of physical and mental health, it was worth trying.

I was also reading a lot about mysticism and other spiritual philosophies.

There is something fundamental about "waking up". Being awake is a primary aspect of conscious experience. Placing it first amongst all other considerations seems like a fitting place.

It is also something that happens in a fixed regular pattern. Every morning the sun rises. Every day my life begins new. If the purpose of life is living, then waking up every day is the first part of that process that happens on a regular schedule.

I can't eat a good diet, exercise a healthy body, or work a productive job until I wake up from sleep. It precedes all of the other activities.

It is important scientifically and spiritually.

### On why it is the only

One mistake I am often guilty of is biting off more than I can chew. I think it is a common story, especially to those prone to depression. Once the depression lifts and a little mania ensues, it is easy to get swept away into a laundry list of promises to oneself.

It is easy to make big plans when one is feeling full of energy and motivation. It is when life forces you to confront reality that those hopes and dreams come crashing down.

I eventually gave up on my jogging hobby. Like many hobbies meant to lift me out of low moods it couldn't stand the test of time.

But even more so, those hobbies were not anchored in an unchanging reality. The sun rises every day. I can count at least on that. If the sun fails to rise tomorrow, I have bigger problems than my mental health to worry about.

It is this steady companion that provides a constant to which I can realign myself.

I don't have multiple complex things to remember or keep straight. I set my alarm and wake up when it goes off.

It is also not easy to do. Everyone knows this. I've spent all of my life sleeping in and enjoying every moment of it. The warm, comfortable bed. The sleepiness.

Getting up at dawn is hard enough that I don't really need another challenge alongside it.

I also think of it like meditation practice. Two common techniques for meditation that I have encountered are related to breath and mantras.

In the case of breath, one focuses their conscious awareness on their breathing. Upon noticing that their mind has wandered from breathing they gently return their awareness back to breathing.

In the case of a mantra, one focuses their conscious awareness on the recitation of the mantra. Upon noticing that their mind has wandered from the mantra they gently return their awareness back to the mantra.

So it is with rising at dawn. Upon noticing that my life is slipping back into a feeling of purposelessness, I gently return my sleep schedule back to dawn.

It is like a meditation practice for active life.

### The Basic Ritual

The most basic ritual is to set ones alarm for the same time as sunrise. When the alarm goes off, get out of bed and go outside. Stand in the morning light for 10 minutes and then you are done.

I have a slightly more elaborate ritual, and how I extend this ritual throughout the day is further explained in a later chapter.

In short, I wake up at sunrise as described above. Then I attend to needs in the bathroom. I thoroughly wash my hands and then face. I apply a moisturizing lotion. I put on appropriate clothes and go outside.

In general, the time between my alarm going off and my feet being outside my door is 10 minutes.

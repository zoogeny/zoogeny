        - Sorting through this massive space
    - Absurdism
    - How old ideas filter into the collective self-conscious and re-emerge as seemingly new ideas fully formed in those influenced by the disperse ancient wisdom

- Introduction
    - showing up is half the battle
    - balance between spirituality, rationality and a lived life

- On rising at dawn
    - For rising as the only virtue - think of Nietzsche and his ubermensch with a single virtue from which all other virtues follow
    - Consider the large number of individuals that get up before dawn as a regular part of their lives (e.g. blue collar workers)
    - scientific evidence that getting sunlight into the eyes is beneficial
    - meditation practice with breath work and mantras
    - I first tried to move from the suburbs to the cities. Then bigger cities. When that didn't work I moved to a rural area. The environment didn't make a difference to my sense of purposelessness

- On daily rituals
    - Why I chose the order for the ritual cycle

- On descriptions
    - Weight lifting analogy: skinny guy gaining weight vs. overweight guy losing weight. Where we start and what our goal is determines our process
    - Some examples of claims of revelation, inspiration, secret knowledge
        - fraternal orders and secret societies
        - satire like illuminatus trilogy and discordianism, church of the subgenius
    - Liberalism
    - Objectivism
    - Multiculturalism
    - A vision of schools that are repositories of descriptions
        - teachers who are forced to teach subjects they themselves despise
        - a record of how successful people became successful rather than how some administrator believes a student should study to reach the same level of success

- Value of cycles
    - Cycles can be viewed as beginning and ending on any of the four phases
    - Cycles embedded within cycles. e.g. What is the cycle within the morning?
    - Cycles in nature:
        - day cycle
        - year cycle
        - lunar cycle
    - Cycles in science:
        - Electromagnetic radiation, which is responsible for light, electricity, and magnetism
        - Sound, acoustics, and resonance
        - evolution of quantum states (Schrödinger's equation)
    - Cycles in body:
        - circadian rhythm and melatonin cycle
    - Cycles in Spiritual traditions
        - Hinduism and Buddhism there is Samsara, Kalachakra and the Wheel of Time
        - Stoicism
        - Greek Pythagoreanism music of celestial spheres

        - Long Cycle Theory
        - Ray Dalio's debt cycle
    - Fourier transform linking time domain and frequency domain
    - Wave phases / periods as related to synchronization/alignment
    - Comparison of day cycle, year cycle, life cycle, ritual cycle
        - the beginning phase of the wave is irrelevant i.e. these are the same:
            - pray, work, eat, clean 
            - clean, pray, work, eat 
            - work, clean, pray, eat 
            - eat, clean, pray, work
        - is the order of the ritual correct?
            - e.g. should prayer precede eating?
    - Relative duration of each section of the cycle
        - e.g. a short prayer, long work, medium eat, short clean
    - Possible addition to app to calculate:
        - period between misalignment and becoming aware of misalignment
        - period between awareness of misalignment and starting to realign
        - period starting realignment and completing realignment
        - frequency of misalignment
    - What is the earth's rotational frequency with respect to the sun?
        - frequency is related to some other, larger containing cycle
        - what larger containing cycle do we consider for the orbit of the earth around the sun?


- Value of love
    - Greek words for love
        - show how these can be expressed using my own definition
    - The external goal
    - The need for sacrifice
    - Connection to emotion

    - Our relationship to our universe
        - To the Nous and to the One
    - Our relationships to 
        - human life
        - mammal life
        - all life on earth (bugs? bacteria?)
        - life that benefits me vs. life that preys on me?
        - life in the galaxy / universe
        - life in all possible universes
    - Relationship of mind and body as compared to a musical chord
        - plus spirit for a triad

    - A comparison to my understanding of Hegel's master / slave dialectic
    - Critical theory
    - Habermas's Communicative rationality
    - Rorty's contingency
    - Dominance of nature
        - that which we are not free to deny (limits of will)

    - Authority as related to protection as related to submission
    - Kabbala and Hasidic notion of God as "making space" for free will
    - Selfishness vs. willing submission
    - A God willing to submit to humans vs. the Nous and the One
        - what does it mean for the Nous to act submissively? In the context of the search for agents that describe a narrative - how is the Nous submissive?
        - how does the existence of human's change the Nous or the One?
    - Unreasonable effectiveness of math
        - Yet rational ideas fall to falsifiability through experiment (Popper)
    - God's willingness to submit in the bible:
        - Jesus' choice to submit at the Garden of Gethsemane
        - God's willingness to spare Sodom and Gomorrah after the pleas of Abraham
            - "Starting at 50 people, Abraham negotiates with God to spare Sodom if 10 righteous people could be found."
    - Consider post modern ideas like Foucault
        - he wrote a lot about power and domination - I have to contend with that
    - Propensity for spiritual traditions to tend towards devotional worship
        - Advaita Vedanta altered by Ramanuja and Madhva
        - Plotinus altered by Proclus nad theurgy

            - See: Taoist theology including "Three pure ones" and "Four Sovereigns"
    - Dominance of Nature with respect to the needs of life
        - breathing, eating, water, sleep, etc.
        - Surrendering to your bodily needs is defining the virtue of life (or survival)

- On "The One"
    - Crime novel analogy: We are half way through but the ending is already written. We still feel the tension of the detective although we know the bad guy will get caught. The thrill is in seeing how the mystery unfolds.
    - Plotinus and the Enneads
    - The Upanishads
    - Relation to the Tao
    - Personal God vs. Impersonal (Nous vs the One?
    - The seat of consciousness (vs. self awareness) -- is it the Nous or the One?

        - in what ways are they similar and different?
    - Mystical experiences and transcendence

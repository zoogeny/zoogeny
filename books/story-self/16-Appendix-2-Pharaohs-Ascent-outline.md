## The Pharaoh's ascent at the temple

- At the base of the temple the Pharaoh arrives in his litter.
- He steps outside of the litter and approaches a stair case
  that leads upwards on the outside of the massive temple
- He begins to slowly ascend the stairs looking forward
- He inspects the temple and finds that it perfectly matches his intentions
    - The craftsman ship is excellent
    - The decoration is exquisite
    - It is exactly as good as he envisioned it could be
    - He is neither pleased nor displeased as he is used to getting what he wants
- He continues to climb until he reaches the alter where he is to say his blessing
    - This blessing has been rehearsed with his high priests
- He turns to face the crowd below
    - This is the first time he is looking back towards the palace
    - From this high vantage point he can see the entire road
      from the temple back to his palace
    - He sees the massive crowd, numbering in the millions
      distributed on either side of the road
- He sees that every person is bowing towards him
- He falls to his knees and bows low to the crowd
    - This was not part of the planned activities for the blessing

"He remembers the ceremony that his priests have rehearsed in preparation for this moment." -- Is this sentence needed? It foreshadows that he will not follow the rehearsed ceremony but I am not certain it is needed.

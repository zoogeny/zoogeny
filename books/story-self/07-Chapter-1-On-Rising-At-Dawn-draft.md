## On Rising at Dawn

I decided to rise at dawn every day for three months. I wanted to see what effect this would have on my physical health, my mental health and my mood.

### Why rise at dawn?

I was feeling depressed. For nearly 4 months I was sleeping in until noon or later. I would lie in bed watching YouTube videos until I felt too guilty to remain in bed. After getting up I would lie down on the couch to watch YouTube videos until it was dark outside.

Some weeks I don't think I left my house. I had quit both of my contracting jobs. My plan was to start live streaming on Twitch but even though I sat at home with nothing to do all day I just wasn't doing the work.

I felt like I had no purpose in life. I felt that I had no energy or motivation to do anything. I was avoiding a massive list of projects I had planned to work on.

Earlier in life I had experienced anxiety. In times of high stress I had panic attacks. A doctor had given me a clear bill of physical health. He told me that if there is no problem with my body then I should consider a problem with my mental health. He recommended that I see a psychiatrist.

I decided to move to a rural area. I decreased my stress load by choosing my work more carefully. I volunteered in my community. I took up exercise. I kept a healthy diet. None of this brought me out of the depression I was experiencing. 

The depression was getting worse. Part of that was due to the restrictions on social activity during a pandemic. Part of it was working from home remotely.

I was trying to address the feeling of lack of purpose in life by watching videos on spirituality.

I came across some videos extolling the benefits of sleep, diet and exercise for dealing with depression. They suggested that sleep was critical.

I made a resolution then to get up at dawn every day for three months. I noticed a difference in just a few days.

The depression lifted and I began experiencing a mania. My mood was elevated, I was optimistic, I even had sweet dreams. No other way to describe it except to say I felt better. I was happier. I was seeing the events of the day in a positive light.

I felt my digestion was better. I was motivated to cook healthy food.

I started to get things done. I started to write. This book is a reminder to myself of where I want to be mentally and physically.

### On why it is the first

There seems to be evidence and it seems reasonable to me that the foundation for health is in good sleep, good diet and good exercise.

My diet was already good, consisting of a wide variety of whole foods, fiber, fruits, vegetables, and high-quality protein. 

I had tried exercises like jogging and weight training. I think I suffered from post exertion malaise which worsened the symptoms of depression. The days after heavy exercise I would lie around sore and tired and even more lethargic than usual.

I had always been a self-professed night-owl. I would eat a dinner at 9:30 pm. I would go to bed at midnight or later. My sleep schedule was one of the only things I had never tried to fix.

I found some advice on waking up at dawn and then immediately going outside to get some sun. There is some scientific evidence that sunlight falling on the retinas triggers a host of biological events associated with circadian rhythms. There is some scientific evidence that managing circadian rhythm is a major part of physical and mental health.

I was also reading a lot about mysticism and other spiritual philosophies. Being awake is a primary aspect of conscious experience. 

Every morning the sun rises. Every day my life begins anew. It is a good frequency to check on my self. I can measure my daily activities with respect to my waking time.

### On why it is the only

It is easy to remember and easy to judge if I am complying with this simple maxim. I don't want to have a complicated project to keep track of. I can check in with myself daily by seeing if I am getting up on time.

It is easy to make big plans when one is feeling full of energy and motivation but to fail to keep plans when one is tired and low on energy. Waking up is a small but important plan that I can reasonably expect myself to stick to.

It is not easy to do. Everyone knows this. I've spent all of my life sleeping in and enjoying every moment of it. The warm, comfortable bed and the cozy feeling of giving into sleepiness. Getting up at dawn is hard enough that I don't really need another challenge alongside it.

I think of it like meditation practice. Two common techniques for meditation that I have encountered are related to breath and mantras.

In the case of breath, one focuses their conscious awareness entirely on their breath. One then endeavors to notice when their mind has wandered from awareness of their breath. One then then gently returns their awareness back to their breath.

In the case of a mantra, one focuses their conscious awareness on the recitation of the mantra. One then endeavors to notice when their mind has wandered from the mantra. One then gently returns their awareness back to the mantra.

So it is with rising at dawn. When I notice that my life is wandering into a feeling of purposelessness, I then gently return my waking time back to dawn.

It is like meditation practice for active life.

### The Basic Ritual

The most basic ritual would be to set an alarm for the time of sunrise. When the alarm goes off I get out of bed and go outside. I stand in the morning light for 10 minutes letting the sunlight bathe my eyes and skin.

My actual daily ritual is slightly more elaborate. In a later chapter I describe in more detail how I extend this ritual throughout the day.

In brief, I wake up at sunrise as described above. I use the bathroom and wash my hands. 

I prepare and eat a small breakfast. I wash my face and clean my teeth. I put on clothes appropriate to the weather. I tidy my bedroom and tidy the kitchen.

I then go outside and bathe in sunlight for approximately 10 minutes. In practice, the time between my alarm going off and my face being bathed in sunlight is approximately 20 minutes.

While I am outside I say a prayer, which includes expressions of thanks and gratitude. I set some positive intentions for the day. I am then ready to do the work that I have planned for that morning.

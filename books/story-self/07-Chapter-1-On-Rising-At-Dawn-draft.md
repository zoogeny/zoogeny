# Chapter 1 - On Rising at Dawn

I decided to rise at dawn every day for three months. I wanted to see what effect this would have on my physical health, my mental health, and my mood.

## Why Rise at Dawn

I was feeling depressed and I was sleeping in each day until noon or later. I would lie in bed watching YouTube videos or scrolling on social media until I felt too guilty to remain in bed. After I got up I would lie down on the couch to watch more YouTube videos until it was dark outside.

For some weeks I did not leave my house. I had quit both of my contracting jobs and I was living off of my savings. My plan was to start live streaming on Twitch and to build a software business related to Internet media. I was not working towards that goal even though I spent all day at home with nothing to do.

I felt like I had no purpose in life. I felt that I had no energy nor motivation to do anything. I was avoiding a massive list of projects that I had planned to work on.

I had experiences of anxiety earlier in my life. I had a few panic attacks in times of high stress. A doctor had given me a clear bill of physical health. He told me that if there is no problem with my body then I must consider a problem with my mental health. He recommended that I see a psychiatrist.

I decided to move from the big city to a rural area. I decreased my stress load by choosing my work more carefully. I volunteered in my community. I kept a healthy diet. I took up exercise. None of this brought me out of the depression I was experiencing.

The depression was getting worse. I suspect that part of that was due to the restrictions on social activity during a pandemic. Another cause could be the change to working from home remotely.

I tried to address a feeling of a lack of purpose in life by watching videos on spirituality. I watched videos extolling the benefits of sleep, diet and exercise for improving mental health. These videos indicated that a consistent sleep schedule was an essential component to improving mental health.

I found within these videos on sleep and mental health the specific recommendation to get five to ten minutes of sunlight onto the retinas of the eyes within one hour of waking. I found similar recommendations to rise early in the morning. These recommendations were supported with scientific evidence that showed a benefit to both physical and mental health.

I made a resolution then to get up at dawn every day for three months. I also committed to getting outside soon after waking and getting sunshine into my eyes for ten minutes. 

My mood improved substantially within just a few days after starting this new routine. I was optimistic and I even had sweet dreams. I was motivated to cook healthy food and I felt my digestion was better. The best way to describe it is to say that I felt better. I was happier. I was seeing the events of the day in a positive light.

I started to get things done. I started to write. This book is a reminder to myself of where I want to be mentally and physically.

## Why It Is the Primary

There is scientific evidence that the foundation for good health begins with good sleep, good diet, and good exercise. These claims seems reasonable to me.

My diet was already good, consisting of a wide variety of whole foods, fiber, fruits, vegetables, and high-quality protein. I did not believe that further improvements to my diet were necessary to promote physical and mental health.

I had tried exercises like jogging and weight training. I did not experience improvements to my physical or mental health from these experiments with increased exercise. I believe I suffered from post exertion malaise. The days after heavy exercise I would lie around sore and tired. I was even more lethargic and unmotivated than usual.

My sleep schedule was one of the only things I had never attempted to improve. I had always believed myself to be a night-owl. I ate a dinner at 9:30 pm. I went to bed at midnight or later.

There is scientific evidence that sunlight falling on the retinas triggers a host of biological events associated with circadian rhythms. There is scientific evidence that managing circadian rhythm is an essential part of maintaining physical and mental health.

I also read a lot about mysticism and other spiritual philosophies. Being awake is a primary aspect of conscious experience. Every morning the sun rises. Every day my life begins anew. The daily cycle is a good frequency to check on my self. I measure my daily activities with respect to my waking time.

I now believe that sleep is the primary aspect of good mental and physical health. When I improved my sleep schedule then my diet and my exercise improved. When I improved my sleep schedule my mental health and mood improved. It fits in with scientific evidence, spiritual knowledge and my own experience.

## Why It Is the Only

A commitment to rising at dawn is memorable and verifiable. I want to avoid routines that are difficult to remember and complicated to keep track of. I check daily if I am getting up on time and quickly going outside into the sun.

To wake up early is a small but important plan that I can reasonably expect myself to accomplish every day. Big plans are easy to make when I am full of energy and motivation. Those same big plans are likely to fail when I am tired and lazy. 

To get up early in the morning is not easy. I enjoy sleeping in, I love my warm comfortable bed, and I surrender to laziness. To get up at dawn is difficult enough that it is unnecessary to have other challenges alongside it.

I think of it like meditation practice. Two common techniques for meditation that I have encountered are related to breath and mantras.

In the case of breath, one focuses their conscious awareness entirely on their breath. One aims to notice when their mind has wandered from awareness of their breath. One then gently returns their awareness back to their breath.

In the case of a mantra, one focuses their conscious awareness on the recitation of the mantra. One aims to notice when their mind has wandered from the mantra. One then gently returns their awareness back to the mantra.

So it is with rising at dawn. When I notice that my life is wandering into a feeling of purposelessness, I then gently return my waking time back to dawn. It is the place I return to. It is like meditation practice for active life.

## The Basic Ritual

The most basic ritual is to set an alarm for the time of sunrise. When the alarm goes off I get out of bed with no delay and I go outside. I stand in the morning light for 10 minutes letting the sunlight bathe my eyes and skin.

My actual daily ritual is slightly more elaborate. In a later chapter I describe how I extend this ritual throughout the day.

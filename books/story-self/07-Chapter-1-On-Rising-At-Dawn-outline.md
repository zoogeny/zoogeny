## Notes

- The paragraphs are long winded and not really connected in a logical flow.

- I am not making a good argument

- I am not communicating the reasoning behind my actions (they seem to be arbitrary)

- Think about adding sources as footnotes (e.g. claims on cortisol hormone changes due to light intake on retinas)

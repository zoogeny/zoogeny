# Chapter 3 - On Descriptions

I wrote this book to describe to others what I am trying to do and why I am trying to do it. I wrote this book to remind myself of the important ideas for living my life.

This book is not meant to tell others what to do. It contains a set of principles and practices that I want to live by. It contains a retelling of some of the ideas that motivated me to adopt these principles and practices.

I am not attempting to be perfectly rational nor entirely empirical. I am not attempting any kind of science.

I am applying reason to my experience. I am contemplating knowledge I have found on spiritual topics. This book is a template I made for myself. I will continue to develop it as I learn more.

I hope that sharing descriptions of my reasoning, my process, my principles, my practices, and my results will help others to find their own way.

## Why Not Prescriptions

I have no secret knowledge. Everything that I know is available to anyone with access to the Internet. I have used Wikipedia, YouTube, Google, blogs and I have read a few books on philosophy and spirituality.

I have not received revelations, prophecies, or instructions from angels or aliens. I have not experienced a mystical transcendence nor an enlightenment. I am not privileged with ancient wisdom handed down over generations from father to son.

I have not studied these topics at a university. I have not apprenticed under a guru or a spiritual teacher. I have no accreditation or qualifications. I have not been licensed to dispense medical advice.

For these reasons and more, I cannot give advice or prescriptions to others.

## On Individuality

I am not much like others. I see that most people are not like most other people.

Everyone has different particular goals. Everyone has a different set of skills, abilities, and expertise. Everyone comes from a different background and has a different collection of experiences. Everyone has different preferences and individual tastes.

No single program could be sufficient for all people. Not all people are able to rise at dawn. Not all people are able to follow my rituals. Some people may already be rising at dawn every day and getting plenty of sun yet they may feel depressed, unfulfilled or that their life has no purpose.

I will not tell anyone else how to live. I will not dictate what are good principles to live by. I will attempt to describe my reasoning for my behavior. I will share the results that I obtain when I follow my own template.

## On Descriptions

I wrote this book to remind myself the important points for building my life. I wrote this book to communicate to others what I am trying to do and why I am trying to do it.

This book is not meant to tell others what to do. It contains a set of principles and practices that I want to live by. It contains a retelling of some ideas that encouraged me to adopt these principles and practices.

I am not attempting to be perfectly rational nor entirely empirical. I am not attempting any kind of science.

I am applying reason to my experience. I am seeking out information. This book is a template I made for myself. I will continue to develop it as I learn more.

### On why not prescriptions

I do not have secret knowledge. Everything that I know is available to anyone with access to the Internet. I have used Wikipedia, YouTube, Google, blogs and I have read a few books on philosophy and spirituality.

I have not received revelations, prophecies or instructions from angels or aliens. I have not had any mystical experiences. I am not privileged with ancient wisdom handed down over generations from father to son.

I have not studied these topics at a university. I have not apprenticed under a guru or spiritual teacher. I have no accreditation or qualifications. I have not been licensed to dispense medical advice.

For these reasons I cannot give advice to others.

I hope that by sharing my reasoning, my process, my principles, my practices and my results that others may find their own way.

### On individuality

I recognize that I am not much like others. When I reflect upon it, I see that most people are not like most other people.

Everyone seems to have different particular goals. Everyone has a different set of skills, abilities and expertise. Everyone comes from a different background and has a different collection of experiences. Everyone has different preferences and individual tastes.

No single program could be sufficient for all people. Not all people are able to rise at dawn. Not all people can follow my rituals.

I do not try to tell anyone how to live. I do not dictate what are good principles to live by. I am trying to describe my individual reasoning for my behavior. I am sharing the results I obtain when I follow my own template.

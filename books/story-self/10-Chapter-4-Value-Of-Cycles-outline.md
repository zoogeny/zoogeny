## Value of Cycles

- Nature is full of cycles
    - day cycle
    - tides
    - seasons
        - equinoxes and solstices
    - lunar fortnight
    - El Niño–Southern Oscillation

- Important physical properties are modeled as waves
    - light
    - sound
    - radio
    - alternating current
    - quantum wave function

- Medical science on body cycles
    - Melatonin and circadian rhythm

- Prominence in spiritual traditions
    - Samsara
    - Wheel of time
    - Eternal return
    - Ouroboros
    - New thought
        - vibrations and "resonance"

### Pattern of a wave
    - birth
    - ascent
    - fall
    - end

    - relation to human life
        - infancy, toddler
        - adolescence
        - adulthood
        - elderly

### Frequencies and Coincidences

- Spectral analysis
    - Fourier transforms
- Synchronization

### Relation to Rituals

- Aligning to frequencies
    - time to notice unaligned
    - time to realign once noticed
    - frequency of misalignment

### Speculations

- Relation to astrology
    - Social cycle theory
- Strauss–Howe generational theory
    - Fourth turning theory
- Kondratiev wave
    - Long cycle theory
- Ray Dalio's debt cycle
- Long waves beyond our record keeping

- Frequencies and coincidences needs more work.
    - specifically the property of of coincident waves. This is a critical point
      in understanding alignment.
    - diagrams would be helpful here

- Diagrams would be useful for the "Pattern of a wave" section

- My definitions of synchronized and aligned should be the same as suitable existing mathematical as on as those terms aren't too obscure. My quick searching was unable to find any existing clear definitions of what I am trying to communicate.

## On  cycles

- Nature is full of cycles
    - day cycle
    - tides
    - seasons
        - equinoxes and solstices
    - lunar fortnight
    - El Niño–Southern Oscillation

- Important physical properties are modeled as waves
    - light
    - sound
    - radio
    - alternating current
    - quantum wave function

- Medical science on body cycles
    - Melatonin and circadian rhythm

- Prominence in spiritual traditions
    - Samsara
    - Wheel of time
    - Eternal return
    - Ouroboros
    - New thought
        - vibrations and "resonance"

### Pattern of a wave
    - birth
    - ascent
    - fall
    - end

    - relation to human life
        - infancy, toddler
        - adolescence
        - adulthood
        - elderly

### Frequencies and Coincidences

- Spectral analysis
    - Fourier transforms
- Synchronization
- Aligning to frequencies
    - time to notice unaligned
    - time to realign once noticed
    - frequency of misalignment

### Speculations

- Relation to astrology
    - Social cycle theory
- Strauss–Howe generational theory
    - Fourth turning theory
- Kondratiev wave
    - Long cycle theory
- Ray Dalio's debt cycle
- Long waves beyond our record keeping

- Frequencies and coincidences needs more work.
- Not sure how much detail to add to each of the spiritual traditions referenced in intro
    - maybe break out spiritual traditions and cycles in physics into their own chapters?
- Not sure how much detail to add to each of the cycles referenced in Speculations

- Diagrams would be useful for the "Pattern of a wave" section
- Perhaps a sentence or two about how the phase of the wave. i.e. these are the same:
    - pray, work, eat, clean 
    - clean, pray, work, eat 
    - work, clean, pray, eat 
    - eat, clean, pray, work

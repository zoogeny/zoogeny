## Value of Cycles

- Nature is full of cycles
    - day cycle
    - tides
    - seasons
        - equinoxes and solstices
    - lunar fortnight
    - El Niño–Southern Oscillation

- Important physical properties are modeled as waves
    - light
    - sound
    - radio
    - alternating current
    - quantum wave function

- Medical science on body cycles
    - Melatonin and circadian rhythm

- Prominence in spiritual traditions
    - Samsara
    - Wheel of time
    - Eternal return
    - Ouroboros
    - New thought
        - vibrations and "resonance"

### Pattern of a wave
    - birth
    - ascent
    - fall
    - end

    - relation to human life
        - infancy, toddler
        - adolescence
        - adulthood
        - elderly

### Frequencies and Coincidences

- Spectral analysis
    - Fourier transforms
- Synchronization

### Relation to Rituals

- Aligning to frequencies
    - time to notice unaligned
    - time to realign once noticed
    - frequency of misalignment

### Speculations

- Relation to astrology
    - Social cycle theory
- Strauss–Howe generational theory
    - Fourth turning theory
- Kondratiev wave
    - Long cycle theory
- Ray Dalio's debt cycle
- Long waves beyond our record keeping

- Diagrams would be useful for the "Pattern of a wave" section
    - How spring, summer, fall and winter match the sections of the wave. Also with labels for morning, afternoon, evening, night. And labels for pray, work, eat, clean

- Diagrams for frequencies and coincidences
    - Frequency vs. period
    - Synchronization
    - Alignment
    - Non-synchronized waves and how their peaks move closer together
    - Non-synchronized waves that have peaks that coincide

- Diagrams for relation to rituals
    - periods for misalignment & recognition of misalignment
    - period between noticing and beginning to realign
    - period between begin to realign and complete realign
    - frequency of misalignment

- My definitions of synchronized and aligned should be the same as suitable existing mathematical as on as those terms aren't too obscure. My quick searching was unable to find any existing clear definitions of what I am trying to communicate.

- Some more information on how these sections of wave are related might be interesting.
    - How spring is like morning is like praying is like childhood
    - How summer is like afternoon is like working is like adolescence
    - How fall is like evening is like eating is like adulthood
    - How winter is like night is like cleaning is like elderly

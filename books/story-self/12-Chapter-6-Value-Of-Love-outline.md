## Value of Love

### Definition of Love
  - two conscious entities working together on a goal external to one or more entities
  - concept of sacrifice
  - concept of transformation
    - related to free will
  - emotion as a force to establish bonding
  - different types of love (from Greek):
    - Agape - brotherly love
    - Eros - sexual passion
    - Philia - friendship, affection
    - Storge - familial
    - Philautia - self
    - Xenia - hospitality

### Mutual Love
  - could be called "True Love"
  - When two individuals are in a reciprocal state of love
    where the other is the external goal they are working together on
      - A loves B when A works with B towards the benefit of B
      - B loves A when B works with A towards the benefit of A
      - mutual love, or "true" love, is when both of these happen simultaneously

### Loving life

  - Opposed to antinatalism or the even more severe efilism
  - To see ourselves as working with nature/universe/God towards some goal

- The alternate views section requires a log of work. I'm not convinced it even needs to be there unless I go into more detail.
  - I should probably give examples of how each type of love in the Greek context can be understood as two entities working towards a shared external goal.

- Loving life needs to be filled out.
  - I'm mixing up "all existence" and "all life"
  - How does this related to the Nous and the One? Is "all existence" a synonym for the Nous or the One? Am I talking about all life on earth? All life in this universe? All life in all possible universes?

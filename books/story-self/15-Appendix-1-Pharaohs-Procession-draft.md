## The Pharaoh's Procession to His Temple

The Pharaoh is sitting tall upon his throne. The Pharaoh is God in the form of man. He rules over a large kingdom on Earth with millions of subjects.

The Pharaoh is wearing his most exquisite regalia. This day is the occasion of the ceremonial opening of a grand temple that was built in his honor. The Pharaoh will visit, inspect, and bless the completed temple.

The Pharaoh stands up tall from his throne. He begins the procession by walking forward with his back straight, his head high, and his eyes facing straight ahead. His pace is slow, rhythmic, and methodical.

The Pharaoh steps down the first step of the dais upon which his throne sits. He passes his councilors and they bow low before him. They are dressed in their finest clothes. His Chief Councilor bows because he is proud of the well run civilization that prospers under the Pharaoh's leadership.

The Pharaoh steps down the second step of the dais and the councilors follow behind him. He passes his priests and they bow low before him. They are dressed in their finest robes. His High Priest bows because he loves the Pharaoh and because he held him as an infant when he blessed the Pharaoh's birth.

The Pharaoh steps down the third step of the dais and the priests follow behind him. He passes his generals and they bow low before him. They are dressed in their finest uniforms. His General of Armies bows because he respects the powerful military commanded by the Pharaoh.

The Pharaoh steps down the fourth step of the dais to the ground and the generals follow behind him. The procession continues along a long hall towards a large open door. The hall is lined with the Pharaoh's personal guard and they bow low before him. His Captain of the Guard bows because he is thankful for the wise administration of justice the Pharaoh exercises over his lands.

The Pharaoh steps through the door into the bright sunlight of a hot summer midday. In the courtyard of his palace before him sits a litter with four men kneeling beside and awaiting his arrival.

The Pharaoh ascends onto the litter and sits. The litter is lifted onto the shoulders of the waiting men.

The Pharaoh faces straight ahead towards a long white road before him. It begins at the courtyard of his palace and continues straight to the foot of his newly constructed temple. 

There are soldiers lining both sides of the road and they face towards to road. Behind the soldier's backs are large crowds gathered on either side of the procession's path.

The procession continues at the same slow, rhythmic, and methodical pace. The councilors, priests, generals, and guards follow on foot behind the Pharaoh's litter.

Each section of crowd alongside the road has been reserved for a particular class of people.

The Pharaoh passes the first section of architects and masons who designed the massive stones used to build his temple. They bow low before him. The chief architect bows because he is awed by the majesty of the grand temple the Pharaoh commissioned.

The Pharaoh passes the second section of artisans who crafted the statues and reliefs of his temple. They bow low before him. The chief artisan bows because he is moved by the beauty of the art for which the Pharaoh has been patron.

The Pharaoh passes the third section of scribes who recorded the history of the Pharaoh in hieroglyphs on the walls of his temple. They bow low before him. The chief scribe bows because he is honored with the greatest collections of scrolls and knowledge in the world.

The Pharaoh passes the fourth section of farmers who grew the food that fed the nation while his temple was built. They bow low before him. The chief of agriculture bows because he is impressed that so many mouths are fed every day due to the planning of the Pharaoh and his aides.

The Pharaoh passes the fifth section of laborers whose blood and sweat has built his temple. They bow low before him. The administrator of the laborers bows because he is amazed that so many individuals were organized in the singular goal of building such a monument.

The Pharaoh passes the sixth section of poor and the most disadvantaged of his subjects. They bow low before him. These people share the privilege of standing at the foot of his temple and they will have the best view of his blessing. A poor old woman falls to her knees and bows low before the Pharaoh. She bows because she knows that the Pharaoh is truly God.

The key to unlock this story's meaning is that the Pharaoh does not wonder about the reason each person has for bowing. He is content that they are bowing but he does not question nor consider why they do so.

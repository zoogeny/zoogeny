- Do not forget humor

- Remember to defend. It is through defending others that you establish authority and invite others to submit to virtue.

- Maybe find somewhere to describe the absurdity of our relationship with the Nous. Perhaps in the On the One chapter I could explicitly deny revelation and inspiration and comment on the fact that our being aligned with the Nous is a coincidence (one that it specifically sought out) and not a coordination. However, since revelation is not a tenable thing then this relationship is an absurdity.

- Worth mentioning that nothing other than my mood changed. It was not like I won the lottery or suddenly became super popular with women. I still have bills to pay and all of the problems I had before the mood change.

- Standardize the capitalization of headers within all chapters

- Bad chapters needing rewrites:
    - Value of Cycles
        - depends how far I get on the frequency coincidence part but it needs much clarification
    - Value of Love
        - The definition is alright but I need to do real work to compare it to other conceptions of love from other spiritualists and philosophers
    - Value of Submission
        - Not clearly expressing an argument here.

## Value of Cycles

My preference is for my philosophy to be rooted in my own experience. I experience cyclic patterns in nature.

Rising at dawn is an attempt to fully experience the day-night cycle. I experience the seasons and their equinoxes and solstices. I experience the lunar fortnight as the moon waxes and wanes. I experience the cyclical tides that result from the forces of the moon.

My education on modern physics taught me that waves are a basis of our understanding of important physical processes. Electromagnetic radiation, which is responsible for light, electricity and magnetism can be described in terms of wavelengths. Sound, acoustics and resonance are understood in terms of waves. The fundamental equation that describes the evolution of quantum states is an equation for a wave.

There is evidence in modern medical science of cycles within my own body. There is circadian rhythm and the melatonin cycle.

Cycles also appear in many spiritual traditions. In Hinduism and Buddhism there is Samsara, Kalachakra and the Wheel of Time. Roman Stoicism references the cyclic nature of existence. Greek Pythagoreanism looked at the world as the music of celestial spheres. The concept of Eternal Return is both ancient and modern alongside the symbol of the Ouroboros. Modern new-thought spiritualists use words like "vibration" and "resonance" to describe aspects of their beliefs.

### Pattern of a wave

I contemplate the wave as split into 4 sections. The first section starts at the lowest point of the wave, gradually rising to a mid-point. The second section continues from the midpoint to the highest point. The third section continues from the highest point then falls to the midpoint. The fourth section continues from that midpoint then falls to the lowest point.

These sections roughly matches my conception of morning, afternoon, evening, night. Of spring, summer, fall, winter. Of child, adolescent, adult, elderly.

This same pattern across my day, my year and my life.

### Frequencies and Coincidences

Frequency is an interesting property of waves. There is a relationship between the time domain of functions and the frequency domain as described by the Fourier transform.

Waves that have different periods have peaks that move closer and further away from each other over time. The distance between the peaks can itself be described by a wave.

Two waves whose peaks are frequently coincident can be seen as synchronized or aligned. I contemplate the degree to which I am aligned or synchronized with natural cycles.

Rising at dawn is a conscious effort to align myself with the day night cycle caused by the Earth's rotational frequency. 

I contemplate the yearly seasonal cycles caused by the Earth's rotation around the sun. I would like to explore how better I can align myself to this longer cycle.

I consider that I may be misaligned with additional cycles that would benefit my physical, mental and spiritual health. I wish to notice when I am misaligned with such cycles.

I would like to know the duration of time between when I become misaligned and when I notice my misalignment. I would like the know the duration of time between when I notice that I am misaligned and when I return to alignment. I would like to know the frequency with which I become misaligned.

### Speculations

I hold these ideas lightly with the goal that they serve as guides and not as rules. They serve as an object of contemplation and a fountain for creativity.

I wonder if astrology came from ancient peoples recognizing cycles of human behavior. Perhaps they saw the cyclic movement of the planets and accidentally related those cycles to analogous cycles in civilizations. For example, the cyclic movement of Mars in the sky accidentally related to the cyclic habit of war-like behavior in civilizations.

Social cycle theory seems to have a long history of speculation from great thinkers including Plato, Aristotle and Cicero. It continues to be revived by modern thinkers while never really finding acceptance in the scientific academy.

Another popular modern conception is the Straussâ€“Howe generational theory, also known as the Fourth Turning Theory. Another is the Kondratiev wave in economics, similar to the Long Cycle Theory. Ray Dalio tackles similar topics in his work on the debt cycle.

There may be cycles that happen long outside of human record keeping. We can find some cycles in geological records but we don't have similar accurate records of aspects of society and civilization. I contemplate what kinds of cycles happen at frequencies on the order of magnitude of 10 years, 100 years, 1000 years, 10,000 years, and beyond.

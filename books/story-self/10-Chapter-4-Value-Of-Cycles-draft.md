## Value of Cycles

My philosophy will have roots in my own experience and I experience cyclic patterns in nature. I experience the cycle of seasons with their equinoxes and solstices. I experience the cycle of the lunar fortnight as the moon waxes and wanes. I experience the cycles of the tides that result from the forces of the moon.

Rising at dawn is an attempt to align my life to the cycle of day and night.

Waves act as a basis for understanding important physical processes. Electromagnetic radiation, which is responsible for light, electricity, and magnetism, can be described in terms of wavelengths. Sound, acoustics, and resonance are understood in terms of waves. The fundamental equation that describes the evolution of quantum states is an equation for a wave.

Cycles manifest within my own body in the circadian rhythm and the melatonin cycle. The heart beats with a rhythm. There are detectable beta waves generated in the brain.

Cycles appear in many spiritual traditions. In Hinduism and Buddhism there is Samsara, Kalachakra and the Wheel of Time. Roman Stoicism references the cyclic nature of existence. Greek Pythagoreanism described the universe as the music of celestial spheres. Eternal Return is a philosophical concept both ancient and modern. There is the even more ancient symbol of the Ouroboros which is thought to represent the cycle of life, death and rebirth. Modern new-thought spiritualists use words like "vibration" and "resonance" to describe aspects of their beliefs.

### Pattern of a wave

The wave is made up of 4 sections. The first section begins at the lowest point of the wave and it gradually rising to a midpoint. The second section continues from the midpoint to the highest point. The third section continues from the highest point then falls to the midpoint. The fourth section continues from that midpoint then falls to the lowest point.

These sections roughly matches my conception of morning, afternoon, evening, night. Of spring, summer, fall, and winter. Of child, adolescent, adult, and elderly. Of eat, clean, pray, work.

This same pattern across my day, my year, my life, and my rituals.

The order of the sections is of no importance. Spring, summer, fall, and winter is no different to fall, winter, spring, summer. Eat, clean, pray, work is no different to pray, work, eat, clean. Since these cycles repeat indefinitely there is no beginning section and there is no final section.

### Frequencies and Coincidences

Frequency is a defining characteristic of a wave or a cycle. It describes how often a particular event happens within a specific amount of time. For example, the frequency of days within one year is 365. This is because in one year the day cycle repeats 365 times.

Period is another measure of a wave or a cycle. It describes the duration between events in some unit of time. For example, the period of a day expressed in hours is 24. This is because a new day cycle begins after 24 hours has passed.

We can think of an event in terms of waves as a fixed point on the wave. For example, we could choose the maximal or minimal point within a cycle. In the case of a day we might choose the 0:00 hour (i.e. 12 am). Every 24 hours we return to the 0:00 hour (i.e. 12 am). The time 0:00 (i.e. 12 am) repeats 365 times each year. It is useful to define the event correlating to the maximal point within a cycle as the cycles peak.

Synchronized cycles have peaks with the same period. The distance between the peaks of synchronized cycles remains at some constant value. Aligned cycles are synchronized cycles where the peaks of the cycles happen simultaneously. The distance between the peaks of aligned cycles is constantly zero.

Cycles that are neither aligned nor synchronized have peaks that move closer and further away from each other over time. The distance between such peaks can be described by a wave.

Some cycles that are neither aligned nor synchronized will exhibit the property that on some occasions the distance between their peaks becomes zero. In this case, the peaks of the cycle are coincident. This occasional alignment of peaks will have its own frequency.

### Relation to Rituals

Rising at dawn is a conscious effort to align myself with the day night cycle caused by the Earth's rotational frequency.

I contemplate the yearly seasonal cycles caused by the Earth's rotation around the sun. I will explore how I can align myself to this longer cycle.

I consider that I am misaligned with additional cycles that would benefit my physical, mental and spiritual health. I wish to become aware of such cycles and I wish to notice when I am misaligned with those cycles.

I would like to know the period between when I become misaligned and when I become aware of my misalignment. I would like to know the period between when I become aware of my misalignment and when I start to realign. I would like to know the period between when I start to realign and when I am completely realigned. I would like to know the frequency with which I become misaligned.

### Speculations

These speculations serve as objects for contemplation and fountains for creativity.
I hold these ideas lightly with the goal that they serve as guides and not as rules. 

I wonder if astrology came from ancient peoples recognizing cycles of human behavior. Perhaps they saw the cyclic movement of the planets and accidentally related those cycles to analogous cycles in civilizations. For example, the cyclic movement of Mars in the sky accidentally related to the cyclic habit of war-like behavior in civilizations.

Social cycle theory seems to have a long history of speculation from great thinkers including Plato, Aristotle and Cicero. It continues to be revived by modern thinkers while never really finding acceptance in the scientific academy.

Another popular modern conception is the Straussâ€“Howe generational theory, also known as the Fourth Turning Theory. Another is the Kondratiev wave in economics, similar to the Long Cycle Theory. Ray Dalio tackles similar topics in his work on the debt cycle.

There may be cycles that happen long outside of human record keeping. We find some cycles in geological records but we do not have similar accurate records for relevant aspects of society and civilization. I contemplate what kinds of cycles happen at frequencies on the order of magnitude of 10 years, 100 years, 1000 years, 10,000 years, and beyond.

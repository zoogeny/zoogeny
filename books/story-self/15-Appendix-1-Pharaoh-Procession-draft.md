## The Pharaoh's procession to the temple

The vision starts with a Pharaoh sitting tall upon his throne. This Pharaoh is God in the form of man. He rules over a large kingdom on Earth with millions of subjects.

The Pharaoh is wearing his most exquisite ceremonial garb and regalia. Today is the day for the ceremonial opening of a grand temple built in his honor. It is the Pharaoh's duty to visit, inspect and bless the completed temple.

The Pharaoh stands up tall from his throne and begins the procession by walking forward with his head high and facing straight ahead. His pace is slow and methodical.

The Pharaoh steps down the first step of the dais upon which his throne sits. He passes his closest councilors and they bow low before him. They are dressed in their finest clothes. His chief councilor bows because he admires the well run civilization that prospers under the Pharaohs leadership.

The Pharaoh steps down the second step of the dais and the councilors follow behind him. He passes by his priests and they bow low before him. They are dressed in their finest robes. His high priest bows because he loves him, because he held him as an infant and blessed his birth.

The Pharaoh steps down the third step of the dais and the priests follow behind him. He passes his general and they bow low before him. They are dressed in their finest uniforms. His General of Armies bows because he respects the powerful military commanded by the Pharaoh. He feels pride at their territory defended and territory conquered.

The Pharaoh steps down the fourth step of the dais to the ground and the generals follow behind him. The procession continues along a long hall towards a large open door. The hall is lined with the Pharaohs personal guard and they bow low before him. His Captain of the Guard bows because he is pleased with the administration of justice the Pharaoh exercises over his lands.

The Pharaoh steps through the door into the bright hot sunlight of a summer midday. In the courtyard before him sits a litter with four men kneeling awaiting his arrival. He ascends into the litter and takes a seat with his face forward. The litter is lifted onto the shoulders of the waiting the men and the procession continues. The councilors, priests, generals and guards follow on foot behind his litter.

Before them is a long straight white road. There are soldiers lining both sides of the road facing inwards and behind the soldiers are large crowds gathered on either side of the processions path. The road directly connects in a straight path from the Pharaohs palace where his throne resides to the newly constructed temple some few kilometers away.

Each section of crowd beside the road has been reserved for a particular class of people. 

The Pharaoh passes the first section of architects and masons. They bow low before him. The chief architect bows because he is impressed with the majesty of the grand temple the Pharaoh commissioned.

The Pharaoh passes the second section of artisans that crafted the statues and reliefs of the temple. They bow low before him. The chief artisan bows because he is moved by the beauty of the art for which the Pharaoh has been patron.

The Pharaoh passes the third section of scribes who were tasked with recording the history of the Pharaoh in hieroglyphs on the walls of the temple. They bow low before him. The chief scribe bows because he is honored with one of the greatest collections of scrolls and knowledge of its kind in the world.

The Pharaoh passes the fourth section of farmers who grew the food that fed the nation while the temple was built. They bow low before him. The chief of agriculture bows because he is impressed that so many mouths are fed every day due to the planning of the Pharaoh and his aides.

The Pharaoh passes the fifth section of laborers whose blood and sweat has built the temple. They bow low before him. The administrator of the laborers bows because he is amazed that so many individuals were organized in the singular goal of building such a monument.

The Pharaoh passes the sixth section of poor and the most disadvantaged of his subjects. They bow low before him. These people share the privilege of standing at the foot of the temple and will have the best view of his blessing. A poor old woman falls to her knees and bows before the Pharaoh. She bows because she knows that the Pharaoh is truly God.

The key to unlock this story's meaning is that the Pharaoh does not care, or even really consider, for what reason each person is bowing. He is content that they are bowing but he does not question why they do so.

## Introduction

This book is a story for myself. It doesn't represent Truth in some ultimate sense. I am not certain I believe it all myself.

One task of philosophy is to answer the question: How does one live a good life? This book tries to answer this difficult question for my self. I do not aim to create a single universal philosophy. I want a grounding for the set of rituals and routines in my own life.

Much of my adult life has been a constant flight from one existential crisis to the next. I am cursed with melancholy which has forced me to endlessly question my purpose in life. I exhaust myself thinking of these questions and they distract me from living.

I suspect that I suffer from depression but I have not sought out a diagnosis from a qualified doctor. I resist the medical route and prefer to adjust my lifestyle instead of seeking therapy or medication. I do not recommend this approach and urge anyone feeling similarly to avoid delay in seeking professional advice.

I have tried many approaches to liberate myself from this state of misery. I have changed my diet, I have exercised, and I have moved to different cities. I have attempted to socialize myself but I have some trouble making intimate connections due to shyness and insecurity.

When I came across the recommendation to focus on my sleep routine I was in the midst of a severe downturn in my mood. The melancholy and pensive nature I have always suffered had intensified.

I had believed myself to be a night owl and I would most often go to bed past midnight. During this downturn in mood it was common for me to go to sleep at 2 am or later. This led to me sleeping in late into the morning or afternoon. I had a bad habit of staying in bed after I woke to watch YouTube videos or endlessly scroll on social media apps.

I had no energy, no motivation and no appetite. I felt unhealthy and my body started to suffer from this lethargy. I felt I was wasting my life but I was comfortable in my bed and the videos were entertaining.

I was aware of anxiousness in the background of my mind. My muscles were atrophying. I had quit my jobs and my savings were depleting. There was a serious crash ahead of me unless I could make a change.

I was beset with questions. What change should I make? How does one live a good life? What is the purpose of life? These questions left me feeling stun locked. With no purpose I had no clear plan.

I felt a positive change within a couple of days of making a commitment to rise at dawn, to go outside soon after waking, and to get sunlight into my eyes. 

Instead of my mind being full of negative thoughts I was thinking positive thoughts. Instead of watching videos all day I was motivated to get small tasks done. 

I started to go on walks during the day. The parks that I walked through seemed more beautiful and alive than I had seen them before. I felt myself coming back into alignment with the rest of the world. The people I met seemed friendlier. My appetite returned and I was motivated to cook healthier food. 

So many of the changes that I had previously tried to force on myself just came about spontaneously. Sometimes it was due to my more positive mood or outlook. Other times it was because I had time available during daylight hours.

I contemplated these changes in the light of my previous questioning. I had not answered the question "What is a good life?" but I had lifted myself out of that seeming depression.

I resolved to keep up the routine for at least three months. The positive effects stayed for weeks. I had not answered the questions but I was no longer preoccupied with them. I was getting things done. I was making progress on my ideas.

I chose to write this book to remind myself that getting up at dawn was the trigger that helped me feel aligned to life. It blossomed into a philosophy inspired by the Mysticism I had been learning when this change occurred.

It may be that these things are just coincident and not strictly related. It is not surprising that I would come across these ideas around the same time.  The communities that surround spirituality and health overlap.

In some of the mystical ideas I saw a parallel to the process I was going through. I was considering questions related to spirituality and God in a newly positive mindset. I felt inspired by this new positive change and motivation.

I can only hope that my description of the coincidence of these ideas and the changes I made for my self may inspire others. 

I don't expect it to solve anyone else's problems or to treat depression in general. I advise and insist that others seek qualified professional help if they suspect they are suffering from depression. I recommend that they follow whatever their chosen professional prescribes for their specific circumstances. I do not imply this book contains medical advice or even good advice for anyone other than myself.

This particular coincidence of rising early, getting some sun and contemplating mystical ideas worked for me. If I could choose just a single virtue then I would choose to get up early and get sunlight into your the eyes. That is all that I ultimately require of myself.

A common proverb is: "showing up is half the battle". I am making a choice to prioritize showing up for life every morning. The mystical and spiritual philosophy is a way to apply reason to that practice.

I want my spiritual ideas and my rational ideas to coincide without one dominating the other. This book is my attempt to balance these ideas in a way that helps me to continue to feel motivated and positive about my life.

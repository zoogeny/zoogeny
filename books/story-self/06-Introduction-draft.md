## Introduction

This book is a story for myself. It doesn't represent Truth in some ultimate sense. I am not even sure I believe it all myself.

I consider one task of philosophy to be to answer the question: How does one live a good life? This book tries to answer this difficult question for my self. I am not aiming to create a single universal philosophy for any other human, or any other kind of life. I want a grounding for a set of rituals and routines for my own life.

I've spent my life in what seems to be a constant flight from one mid-life crisis to the next. I've been having mid-life crises since I was in my twenties. I am cursed with a melancholy that has forced me to endlessly question my purpose in life. I exhaust myself contemplating these kinds of questions pretty much nonstop. These thoughts distract me from getting on with the business of living.

I suspect that I could easily get a diagnosis of depression from a qualified doctor if I sought it out. I have always resisted going the medical route, preferring to adjust my lifestyle instead of seeking therapy or medication. I have tried many different approaches to liberating myself from this state of misery that my own mind imposes on itself. I have changed my diet, I have exercised, I have changed the city where I live and my environments. I have attempted to socialize myself but my preoccupation with these topics as well as my shy and insecure personality has hampered that.

When I discovered the procedure of getting up early and getting sunlight into the eyes as soon as possible I recognized that I had not yet tried that approach. At that time I was in the midst of a severe downturn in my mood. The melancholy and pensive nature I have always suffered had intensified. I had always considered myself a night owl, often going to bed well past midnight. During this phase it was common for me to go to bed at 2 am or later. This led to me sleeping in very late into the morning or afternoon. I had gotten into an even worse habit of lying in bed to watch YouTube videos or scroll on one of the many social media time wasting apps on my phone.

I recognized it was unhealthy and I felt my body starting to suffer from the lethargy. I had no energy, not motivation and no appetite. I was aware I was wasting away my life but I didn't even feel bad. It was comfortable in my bed, the videos were entertaining and I enjoyed the ease of coasting with no purpose.

I was also aware of an anxiousness in the background. My muscles were atrophying. I had quit my jobs and my savings were depleting. There was a serious crash ahead of me unless I could make a change.

What change should I make? How does one live a good life? What is the purpose of life? These questions left me feeling stun locked. With no purpose I had no clear plan.

I felt a change within a couple of days of getting up early in the morning and getting outside into the light as soon as possible. Within a couple of days my mood completely shifted. Instead of my mind being full of negative thoughts I was thinking positive thoughts. Instead of watching videos all day I was motivated to get small tasks done. I started to go on walks during the day. The parks that I walked through seemed more beautiful and alive than I had seen them before. I felt myself coming back into some kind of alignment with the rest of the world.

The people I met seemed friendlier. My appetite returned and I was motivated to cook healthier food. So many of the changes that I had previously tried to force on myself just came about spontaneously. Sometimes it was due to my more positive mood or outlook. Other times it was because I had the time available during daylight hours.

I contemplated these changes in the light of my previous questions. I hadn't answered the question "What is a good life?" but I had lifted myself out of that seeming depression.

I resolved to keep up the routine for at least three months. The positive effects stayed for weeks. I hadn't answered the question but I was no longer preoccupied with it. I was actually getting things done. I was making progress on ideas.

I began to write this book to remind myself that getting up at dawn was the trigger that helped me feel aligned to life. It blossomed into a philosophy inspired by the mysticism I had been learning when this change occurred.

It may be that these things are just coincident. It is not so surprising that I would come across these ideas around the same time since the communities that surround them overlap.

In some of the mystical ideas I saw parallels to the process I was going through. I was considering questions related to spirituality and God in the newly positive mindset. I felt inspired by this new positive change and motivation.

Perhaps the coincidence of these ideas may have a similar effect on others. I can only hope. I don't expect it to solve everyone's problems or to cure depression. Most people would probably benefit from professional help if they are feeling depressed. I recommend that they follow whatever that professional prescribes. So I do not wish to imply this is medical advice or even imply that it is good advice for anyone other than myself.

This particular coincidence of rising early, getting some sun and contemplating mystical ideas worked for me. If I could choose just a single virtue from it all then it would be to get up early and get the sun into your the eyes. That is all that I ultimately require of myself.

A common proverb is that half of the battle is just showing up. So I'm making a choice to prioritize showing up for life every morning. The mystical and spiritual philosophy is just a way to apply some kind of reason to that practice.

I want to seek a balance. I want my spiritual ideas and my rational ideas to coincide without one dominating the other. This book is my attempt to balance these ideas in a way that helps me to continue to feel motivated and positive about my life.

## Introduction

This book is a story for my self. It does not represent Truth in an ultimate sense. I am uncertain if I believe it all myself.

One task of philosophy is to answer the question: How does one live a good life? This book tries to answer this difficult question for my self. I have not created a universal philosophy that is applicable to all beings at all times, I have described a grounding for the set of rituals and routines in my own life.

Much of my adult life has been a flight from one existential crisis to the next. I am cursed with melancholy and that has forced me to endlessly question my purpose in life. I ruminate on unanswerable questions and they have distracted me from living.

I suspect that I suffer from depression but I have not sought out a diagnosis from a qualified doctor. I resist the medical route and I prefer to adjust my lifestyle instead of seeking therapy or medication. I do not recommend this approach and I urge anyone feeling that they may suffer from depression to avoid delay in seeking professional advice.

I have tried many approaches to liberate myself from this state of misery. I have changed my diet, I have exercised, and I have moved to different cities. I have attempted to socialize myself but I have some trouble making intimate connections due to shyness and insecurity.

I was in the midst of a severe downturn in my mood before I came across the recommendation to focus on my sleep routine. The melancholy and pensive nature I have always suffered had intensified.

I had believed myself to be a night owl and I normally went to bed after midnight. During this downturn in mood it was common for me to go to sleep at 2 am or later. I slept until very late in the morning or into the early afternoon. I had a bad habit of staying in bed after I woke to watch YouTube videos or endlessly scroll on social media apps.

I had no energy, no motivation, and no appetite. I felt unhealthy, my body started to suffer from this lethargy and my muscles were atrophying. I had quit my jobs and my savings were depleting. I was aware of a quiet anxiousness in the background of my mind. I was wasting my life but I felt comfortable in my bed and the videos were entertaining. There was a serious crash ahead of me unless I made a change.

I was beset with questions. What change should I make? How does one live a good life? What is the purpose of life? These questions left me feeling unable to act. With no purpose, I had no clear plan.

I felt a positive change within a couple of days of making a commitment to rise at dawn, to go outside soon after waking, and to get sunlight into my eyes. 

Instead of my mind being full of negative thoughts I was thinking positive thoughts. Instead of watching videos all day I was motivated to get small tasks done. Instead of lying in bed all morning I started to go on walks during the day.

I felt myself coming back into alignment with the rest of the world. The parks that I walked through seemed more beautiful and alive than I had seen them before. The people I met seemed friendlier. My appetite returned and I was motivated to cook healthier food.

Many of the changes that I had previously attempted to force on myself came about spontaneously. The changes came about due to my positive mood and because I had additional time available during daylight hours.

I contemplated these changes in the light of my previous questioning. I had not answered the vexing questions but I was no longer preoccupied with them. I had no answer to the question "What is a good life?" but I had lifted myself out of that seeming depression.

I resolved to keep up the routine for at least three months. The positive effects stayed for weeks. I was getting things done and I was making progress on my ideas.

I chose to write this book to remind myself that getting up at dawn was the change that helped me feel aligned to life. This change blossomed into a philosophy inspired by the Mysticism that I had been learning while this change occurred.

I saw a parallel to the process I was going through in some of the mystical ideas I was encountering. I considered questions related to spirituality and God in a newly constructive mindset. I felt inspired by this new beneficial change to my routines and I was motivated by this new optimism.

It is possible that the benefits I experienced due to the changes to my routines and the ideas of spirituality are merely coincident and not strictly related. It is not surprising that I came across these ideas around the same time because the communities that surround spirituality, health, and lifestyle overlap.

I do not expect that these ideas or practices will solve anyone else's problems. I do not claim that they will treat depression or any other mental health issues. I advise and insist that others seek qualified professional help if they suspect they are suffering from depression. I recommend that they follow whatever their chosen medical professional prescribes for their specific circumstances. I do not imply that this book contains medical advice or even good advice for anyone other than myself.

I hope that my description of the coincidence of these ideas and the changes I made for my self will inspire others.

This particular coincidence of waking at sunrise, getting outside to get sunlight into my eyes, and contemplating mystical ideas worked for me. I believe that waking at sunrise and getting sunlight into the eyes is the essential change.

A common proverb is: "showing up is half the battle". I am making a choice to prioritize showing up for life every morning. The mystical and spiritual philosophy is a way to apply reason to that practice.

I want my spiritual ideas and my rational ideas to coincide without one dominating the other. This book is my attempt to balance these ideas in a way that helps me to continue to feel motivated and positive about my life.

## On Daily Rituals

My rituals are not laws. I try not to be overly strict about them. Failing to adhere to a ritual does not imply a need for judgement, punishment or feelings of guilt.

Rituals are reminders. They act as milestones for the day, week, month or year. They help me to know when I am keeping to my own standards.

I keep an open mind to changes. I do not fret if I skip a meal, miss a prayer or forget to wash the dishes immediately after a meal.

I prioritize my commitments to my family and friends, to my work, and to my community.

I notice when I miss rituals but I do not judge myself. I can also do a minimal set of ritual activities if I am unable to do a full ritual.

My rituals fit around my life, I do not fit my life around my rituals. If leading a good life conflicts with a ritual then I will choose to lead the good life.

### Morning ritual

Morning ritual at dawn is the most important ritual. Waking up at dawn provides a foundation for the entire day. Rising at dawn and getting straight out of bed is a challenge.

I usually require to go to the bathroom immediately upon waking up. I then wash my hands to promote hygiene.

I may make myself a small breakfast, although this does not happen every day. I drink some water.

I wash my face and clean my teeth. I apply moisturizing lotion to help maintain a healthy skin microbiome and add protection to my skin.

I change into clothing appropriate for the weather. I tidy my bedroom and the kitchen.

I then step outside as close to sunrise as possible. It takes approximately twenty minutes to get to this point: waking up, eating breakfast, washing my face and cleaning my teeth, getting dressed and doing some tidying.

I stay outside for ten minutes regardless of weather. I raise my face to the sun and feel its warmth and light. I let sunshine enter into my eyes but do not stare directly at the sun.

I say a prayer for the day. I consider what I want to get done. I consider what I am thankful for.

I am then ready to start my work for the day. Often the first thing I do in the morning is write in my journal.

### Afternoon ritual

The afternoon ritual has a flexible start time. It is not as essential as the morning ritual so I am less strict in attempting to complete it perfectly. I can start the ritual early or late depending on my schedule for the morning and afternoon.

Before the ritual I review my schedule and record what I accomplished in the morning. I will reconsider my schedule for the afternoon and evening.

I wash my hands and then I prepare and eat lunch. This is usually a large sized meal. It will contain a balanced combination of nutritious proteins, carbohydrates, fibers, and fats.

I clean any dirty dishes, tidy the kitchen and then floss and brush my teeth. If I have extra time available I may tidy up other areas of my living and working spaces.

I may then shower at this time or I may choose to wash my face. I may change into clothing more appropriate for afternoon activities.

I make a silent prayer of thanks and intention. I am then ready to start my work for the afternoon.

### Evening ritual

The evening ritual has a flexible start time. Some days it happens right at the end of my afternoon, roughly 6pm. Other days it might happen at 7pm or 8pm. I try to avoid eating within 2-3 hours of sleeping.

I wash my hands and then I prepare and eat dinner. This is usually a medium sized meal but it may be large if I had a small lunch. It will contain a balanced combination of nutritious proteins, carbohydrates, fibers, and fats. 

I wash dishes, tidy the kitchen and then floss and brush my teeth.

I say a small prayer of thanks and intention. I am then ready for my late evening leisure which can include exercise, yoga, watching YouTube videos, reading or playing with my dog.

### Reasoning for rituals

Rituals are not critical to success so I try to keep them lighthearted. I focus on waking up at dawn and getting outside. Rituals are a template for a perfect day but not something to obsess about.

Rituals provide structure. They break the day into clear sections. They are similar to each other and keep my mind and body aligned to a consistent frequency.

I eat a meal, clean up, say a prayer, and then get to work. I repeat this three times a day. The rituals align with my meals.

I use the rituals as milestones throughout the day. They give me multiple opportunities to adjust my day, alter my schedule or set a new intention.

The rituals incorporate a set of good hygiene habits including washing myself and cleaning my house and work areas.

### Future rituals

I will look for opportunities to incorporate new rituals at new frequencies. These are daily rituals but I could also have weekly and monthly rituals.

For example, I have a monthly habit to review my finances. This could be transformed into a ritual.

I would like to add simple prayers of thanks upon waking, before meals and before sleeping.

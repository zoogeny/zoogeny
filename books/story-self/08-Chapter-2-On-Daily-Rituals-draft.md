## On Daily Rituals

Rituals are reminders that act as milestones for the day, week, month, or year. They help me to notice when I am keeping to my own standards. 

Rituals are guidelines and not laws. I avoid being overly strict about them. I do not punish myself or feel guilt when I fail to adhere to a ritual. I do not worry if I skip a meal, miss a prayer, or forget to wash the dishes immediately after a meal.

I do a minimal set of ritual activities if I am unable to complete a full ritual. I notice when I unable to do any of the ritual activities but I do not judge myself harshly.

I keep an open mind to changes in my schedule. I prioritize my commitments to my family, to my friends, to my work, and to my community. My rituals fit around my life, I do not fit my life around my rituals. If leading a good life conflicts with a ritual then I will choose to lead the good life rather than force myself to complete a ritual.

### Morning Ritual

The morning ritual at dawn is the most important ritual of the day. Waking up at dawn provides a foundation for the rest of the day. Rising at dawn and getting straight out of bed is a challenge.

I set an alarm for the time of sunrise and get straight out of bed when it goes off. I go to the bathroom then I wash my hands.

I make myself a small breakfast and I drink some water. I feed my dog.

I wash my face and then I brush and floss my teeth. I shave and then I apply moisturizing lotion to my skin. I change into clothing appropriate for the weather. I tidy my bedroom and I tidy the kitchen.

It takes thirty minutes to get to this point: wake up, eat breakfast, wash my face and brush my teeth, get dressed, and do some tidying.

I then go outside to get as much sunlight into my eyes as possible. I stay outside for ten minutes regardless of weather. I raise my face to the sun and feel its warmth and light. I let sunshine enter into my eyes but I do not stare directly at the sun.

I say a prayer for the day. I consider what I am thankful for. I consider what work that I want to get done.

I start most days taking a hike in nature with my dog. When I return from the hike I write in my journal.

I am then ready to start my work for the morning.

### Afternoon Ritual

The afternoon ritual has a flexible start time. It is not as essential as the morning ritual so I am less strict in attempting to complete it perfectly. I will start the ritual early or late depending on my schedule for the morning and afternoon.

I wash my hands and then I prepare and eat lunch. This is usually a large sized meal. It will contain a balanced combination of nutritious proteins, carbohydrates, fibers, and fats.

I clean any dirty dishes, I tidy the kitchen, and then I floss and brush my teeth. If I have time then I will tidy up other areas of my living and working spaces.

I take some time for relaxation, usually letting the dog out and playing fetch with him.

I may then shower. I may change into clothing more appropriate for afternoon activities.

I make a silent prayer of thanks and intention. I am then ready to start my work for the afternoon.

### Evening Ritual

The evening ritual has a flexible start time. Some days it happens at 6pm while other days it happens at 7pm or 8pm. I try to avoid eating within 2-3 hours of sleeping and I always feed my dog at 6pm.

I wash my hands and then I prepare and eat dinner. This is usually a medium sized meal but it may be larger if I had a small lunch. It will contain a balanced combination of nutritious proteins, carbohydrates, fibers, and fats. 

I then wash dishes, tidy the kitchen, and then floss and brush my teeth.

I say a small prayer of thanks and intention. I am then ready for my late evening leisure which will be some combination of exercise, yoga, watching YouTube videos, reading, or training and playing with my dog.

### Reasoning for Rituals

I focus on waking up at dawn and getting outside to get sun into my eyes as soon as possible. The remaining daily rituals are a template for a perfect day but not something that I obsess over.

Rituals provide my life with structure. They break the day into clear sections. They are similar to each other and keep my mind and body aligned to a consistent frequency. I use the rituals as milestones throughout the day. They give me multiple opportunities to adjust my day, alter my schedule or set a new intention.

My rituals align with my meals. They incorporate a set of good hygiene habits including washing myself and keeping my house and work areas clean.

Rituals are not simply routines. I treat them solemnly and ceremoniously and I keep in mind their purpose. I don't just run through them like I am following a habitual process. I take the time to consider each step of the ritual and its significance.

### Steps of the ritual

There are four basic steps to the rituals I keep during the day: eat, clean, pray, work.

Eating is a reminder that diet is a significant factor in my energy levels during the day and my overall health. Cleaning promotes hygiene and decreases the likelihood of illness and infections. Praying reminds me to take time to feel gratitude and to plan my time with conscious effort. Working is the process of getting the tasks I have planned to completion.

I prepare and eat a meal, clean up, say a prayer, and then get to work. I repeat this three times a day.

### Future Rituals

I will add new rituals at new frequencies as I learn more. These are my daily rituals but I could also have weekly and monthly rituals. For example, I have a monthly habit to review my finances. This could be transformed into a ritual.

I plan to add simple prayers of thanks upon waking, before meals, and before sleeping.

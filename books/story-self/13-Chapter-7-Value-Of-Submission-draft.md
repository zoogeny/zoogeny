## Value of Submission

When I write on dominance and submission I am considering social hierarchy and not sexual role play.

I am writing about dominance that is mistaken for an intent to oppress. I am writing about a submission that is mistaken for weakness.

I am attempting to define these terms in my own way.

### Dominance

Nature is dominant over conscious beings. Everything is seemingly bound by the second law of thermodynamics and the effects of gravity. The free will of conscious individuals, if it exists at all, is subject to the limits imposed by nature.

Nature can also exert tremendous power over the affairs of conscious individuals in the form of tornados, hurricanes, floods, earthquakes, lighting and wildfires. Given the power and intensity of events such as solar flares and supernova it is hard to imagine any conscious entity that could entirely ignore the power of nature.

The intellect is dominated by logic and mathematics. The process of science dominates our rational minds through empiricism.

The restrictive role of dominance can be expressed as a protective force. I think of the authority of a judge to settle disputes. We see a righteous judge as protecting the innocent.

Some traditional views put God into the role of the ultimate source of authority. God sets the rules, judges our compliance and rewards or punishes based on our actions. In this view God is the most dominant force possible.

### Submission

Submission is the critical step to defining virtue. It is through a free-will choice to limit ones own agency that we define what is virtuous in the world.

We choose to submit ourselves to laws and civil constitutions. By doing so we affirm our belief in the virtue of fairly ordered societies.

We submit ourselves to social conventions. By doing so we affirm our belief in the virtue of harmonious community.

Love is the submission of a conscious individual to the needs of another individual.

We may choose to submit for the protection it affords. One may choose to submit to the ruling of a judge because of the belief that the judge will offer protection for ones rights. The judge offers protection to the plaintiff in exchange for the plaintiff's willingness to submit to the judge's ruling.

I have chosen to submit myself to rising at dawn. My submission is an affirmation of  belief in the virtue of aligning oneself with natural cycles. I follow natures lead instead of asserting my own dominance.

A view of God that I contemplate is a God that is willing to submit to humans. I think of the story of Jesus where God chose to suffer and die for humans. 

I think of a God that listens to the prayers of conscious individuals. When God listens to our prayers we are in a communion with God to define virtue. I contemplate that God is willing to submit to our pleas.

This view is of a changing God. It is a view where conscious individuals participate with God in the creation of the world as we desire it to be.

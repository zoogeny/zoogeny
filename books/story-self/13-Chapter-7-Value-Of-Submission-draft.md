## Value of Submission

Submission is wrongly associated with weakness or victimhood. Dominance is wrongly associated with strength or oppression. I am attempting to define these terms in my own way.

### Dominance

Nature is totally dominant over conscious beings. Everything is bound by the immutable laws of physics including the second law of thermodynamics and the effects of gravity. The free will of conscious beings, if it exists at all, is subject to the limits imposed by natural laws.

Nature exerts tremendous power over the affairs of conscious beings in the form of tornados, hurricanes, floods, earthquakes, lighting, and wildfires. No living entity within the universe is entirely free from the dominance of nature considering the power and intensity of events such as supernovas.

Logic and mathematics dominate the intellect. The process of science dominates our rational minds through empiricism.

Dominance is a protective force. A judge has the authority to settle disputes. A righteous judge protects the innocent, a corrupt judge protects the guilty.

Some traditional beliefs consider God to be the ultimate source of authority. God sets the rules, judges our compliance, and rewards or punishes us based on our actions. God is the most dominant force possible for those that hold this view.

### Submission

Submission defines virtue. It is through a choice to limit ones own agency that one defines for oneself what is virtuous in the world.

We choose to submit ourselves to laws and civil constitutions. This submission affirms our belief in the virtue of fairly ordered societies.

We choose to submit ourselves to social conventions. This affirms our belief in the virtue of harmonious community.

Love is the submission of a conscious being to the needs of another individual.

We may choose to submit to another for protection. For example, one may choose to submit to the ruling of a judge because of one's belief that the judge will offer protection for one's rights. The judge offers protection to the plaintiff in exchange for the plaintiff's willingness to submit to the judge's ruling.

I have chosen to submit myself to rising at dawn. My submission is an affirmation of my belief in the virtue of aligning myself with natural cycles. I follow natures lead instead of asserting my own dominance.

A view of God that I contemplate is a God that is willing to submit to humans. I think of the story of Jesus where God chose to suffer and to die for humans. I think of Abraham pleading with God to spare Sodom if God can find just ten righteous men.

I think of a God that listens to the prayers of conscious beings. When God listens to our prayers we are in a communion with God to define shared virtues. I contemplate that God is willing to submit to our pleas.

This view is of a changing God. It is a view where conscious beings participate with God in the creation of the world as we desire it to be.

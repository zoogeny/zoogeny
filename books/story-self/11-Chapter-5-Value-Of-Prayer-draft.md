## Value of Prayer

Prayer is an expression of thanks and gratitude. Prayer sets an intention towards an action that I have planned to take. Prayer helps to express a desire for a positive outcome to a situation or circumstance.

Prayer is not related to any particular religious or spiritual tradition. Prayer is not a plea nor a request for needs to be fulfilled. Prayer is not worship nor is it directed towards a specific god, spiritual entity, or saint.

As an example of thanks and gratitude, in prayers around meals I express thanks for the food I eat. I am thankful for the people and animals in my life. I may be thankful to have completed some productive activity or planned task. I may be thankful for beautiful weather. I find a way to be thankful every time I pray.

As an example of setting an intention to do some action or activity, I may intend to complete some work such as writing a chapter of a book. I will contemplate that work and set the intention to act on writing that chapter.

As an example of desiring a positive outcome to a situation, I may desire for good weather, for safe passage, or for a medical procedure to go well. This is useful for cases where I do not have complete control over the outcome through my own actions.

I keep the prayers concise. An example of a prayer: "I am thankful that there is no rain today and that I have some healthy breakfast to eat. I will go to exercise at the gym this morning. I hope to exercise safely and to avoid injury."

When I pray in this manner I provide myself with an objective and a small plan on how I will spend the next few hours.

### When Not Sure What to Do Next

When I feel unsure about what I should be working on then I will reflect on the intentions I set during my last prayer.

I will consider if I have time for some "extra" to go above and beyond my original expectations. I may do additional work that I considered nice-to-have or I may work to improve upon the task I have just completed.

I will check my future schedule to see if I can bring intentions from the future into the present. I avoid waiting when I have the opportunity to start some future task in the present.

If I am still unsure of what to work on next then I will start a new ritual. I will eat a small snack, do a bit of cleaning, say a new prayer to set a new intention, and then get to work on the new intention. Prayer acts as part of a reset that I use in times of doubt.

### When Feeling Unable to Do Anything

When one hears of tragedy and catastrophe, oftentimes there is nothing that can be done. For example, a natural disaster in some remote area of the world. I may wish to act, for example to send some money or to donate blood, but these may not be possible to act upon immediately or appropriately.

Prayer helps to sow the seed of intention to action in my mind. Prayer keeps the incident fresh in my memory. I remain open to opportunities to contribute some action if a reasonable opportunity becomes available.

Prayer prompts me to prepare myself for similar tragedy. I can ensure that I have the appropriate supplies and skills to deal with such a tragedy if it were to affect me or my loved ones.

### On Expectation and Reward

I trust that I will receive rewards appropriate to my actions. 

I seek to recognize the rewards I receive for my actions most especially when they do not match my expectations. My limited viewpoint is often unable to appreciate a good unexpected reward. The rewards I do not expect are capable of exceeding my desires.

I avoid prayers for particular rewards. I do not pray for particular possessions or material wealth. I aim to avoid feelings of disappointment when I fail to receive an expected reward.

I wish to be truly thankful for all rewards but I am especially thankful for those reward that I do not expect.

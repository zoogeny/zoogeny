## Value of Prayer

I think of prayer as directed contemplation. I do not think of any particular religious or spiritual tradition.

I use prayer first as an expression of thanks and gratitude. I use prayer second to set an intention towards an action I have planned to take. I use prayer third to express a desire for a general outcome to a situation.

As an example of thanks and gratitude, in prayers around meals I express thanks for the food. I am thankful for the people and animals in my life. I may be thankful to have completed some productive activity or planned task. I may be thankful for beautiful weather. I try to find a way to be thankful every time I pray.

As an example of setting an intention to do some action or activity, I may intend to complete some work such as writing a chapter of a book. I will contemplate that work and set the intention to act on writing that chapter.

As an example of desiring a general outcome to a situation, I may desire for good weather, for safe passage, or for a medical procedure to go well. This is useful for cases where I do not have complete control over the outcome through my own actions.

I try to keep the prayers concise. As an example of the kind of prayer I make: "I am thankful that there is no rain today and that I have some healthy breakfast to eat. I will go to exercise at the gym today. I hope to exercise safely and to avoid injury."

When I pray in this manner I provide myself with an objective and a small plan on how I will spend the next few hours.

### When not sure what to do next

I often wonder throughout the day what I should do next. When I feel unsure about what I should be working on then I will reflect on the intention I set during my last prayer.

In some cases where my intention has been completed early then I will consider if I have time for some "extra" to go above and beyond my expectations. I may do an additional task or I may improve upon the task I have just completed.

In other cases where my intention has been completely early then I will consider looking at my future schedule. I see if I can bring intentions from the future into the present.

I can be guilty of waiting when I have the opportunity to do some future task now. I try to remember that I do not have to wait until the scheduled time of a task to do it. Instead of waiting for the future to come to me, I can actively go out to meet the future.

When I am still stuck for what to work on next then it may be best to start a new ritual. I will eat a small snack, do a bit of cleaning, say a new prayer to set a new intention, and then get to work on the new intention. Prayer acts as part of a reset that I use in times of doubt.

### When feeling unable to do anything

Oftentimes, upon hearing bad news, there is nothing that can be done. For example, a natural disaster in some remote area of the world.

I may wish to act, maybe to send some money or to give blood, but these may not be possible to act upon immediately or appropriately.

Prayer can help me to sow the seed of intention to action in my mind. Prayer helps to keep the incident fresh in my memory. I remain open to opportunities to contribute some action if such opportunity becomes available.

This kind of prayer is a reminder of the positive outcome that is currently beyond my limited means to act towards. Prayer may prompt me to prepare myself for similar tragedy. I can ensure that I have the appropriate supplies and skills to deal with such a tragedy if it were to affect me or my loved ones.

### On expectation and reward

I avoid prayers for particular rewards. I do not pray for specific possessions or particular material wealth. I do not wish to feel disappointed in the case where an expected reward is not received for my actions.

I remain open to seeing rewards I receive for my actions most especially when they do not match my expectations.

I recognize that my own limited viewpoint is often unable to appreciate a good unexpected reward. The rewards I do not expect can exceed my desires. I trust that I will receive rewards appropriate to my actions. 

I wish to be truly thankful for all rewards but especially those reward that I do not expect.

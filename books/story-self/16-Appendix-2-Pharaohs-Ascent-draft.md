## The Pharaoh's Ascent at His Temple

The Pharaoh arrives at the base of his temple carried upon a litter. The four men carrying the litter lower it to the ground.

The Pharaoh descends from the litter and approaches a large stone stair case built into the side of his temple. The stairs extend up along the outside of his temple to a platform high above. The Pharaoh will make his blessing for his temple from an alter upon this platform.

The Pharaoh slowly, rhythmically, and methodically ascends the stairs as he inspects the temple. He appreciates the excellent craftsmanship. He appreciates the exquisite decorations. He appreciates the thoughtful inscriptions.

The Pharaoh contemplates that the temple is exactly as he envisioned it. He is neither pleased nor displeased. He is neither satisfied nor dissatisfied. He has become accustomed to his high standards being met.

The Pharaoh completes the ascent to the platform and stands before the alter where his blessing will take place. He prepares for the ceremony that his priests have planned in preparation for this moment.

The Pharaoh turns to face the crowd from this great height. He can see the complete extent of the white road, from the base of the temple to the courtyard of his palace. He sees in one view the whole crowd before him, millions of his subjects all bowing low towards him.

The Pharaoh falls to his knees and bows low to the crowd below. His councilors, priests, generals, and all his subjects are astonished. This act was not planned as part of the ceremony.

In the same way that the Pharaoh does not wonder why his subjects bow to him, so it is that we do not know why the Pharaoh chose to bow to his subjects that day.

## The Pharaoh's ascent at the temple

This vision came years after the original vision. It came after I made the change to rise at dawn. It came after my dive into mysticism.

The Pharaoh arrives at the base of the temple carried upon a litter. The four men carrying the litter lower it to the ground. 

The Pharaoh steps down from the litter and approaches a large stone stair case built into the side of the temple. The stairs extend up along the outside of the temple to a platform high above. The Pharaoh will make his blessing for the temple from this platform.

The Pharaoh slowly ascends the stairs. He is inspecting the temple. He appreciates the excellent craftsmanship. He appreciates the exquisite decorations on display.

The Pharaoh contemplates as he climbs that the temple is exactly as he had envisioned it. He is neither pleased nor displeased. He is neither satisfied nor dissatisfied. His high expectations have been met as he has become accustomed.

The Pharaoh completes the ascent and reaches the alter where his blessing will take place. He remembers the ceremony that his priests have rehearsed in preparation for this moment.

The Pharaoh turns to face the crowd. He can see the entire white road from the base of the temple to the courtyard of his palace. He sees in one view the entire crowd before him, millions of his subjects all bowing low towards him.

The Pharaoh falls to his knees and bows low to the crowd below. His councilors, priests, generals, and all the people are astonished. This act was not planned as part of the ceremony.

In the same way that the Pharaoh does not care to know why his subjects bow to him, so we do not know why the Pharaoh chose to bow that day.

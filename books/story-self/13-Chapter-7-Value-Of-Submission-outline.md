## Value of Submission

### Dominance

- the dominant character of nature
    - unchangeable properties of nature
    - power of nature
    - logic and mathematics

- The role of the protector
    - relation to authority

- Traditional view of God as dominant
    - the ultimate source of authority
    - judge and punisher of transgressions

### Submission

- a definition of virtue
    - as resulting from a free-will choice to submit to some value
    - protection as an invitation to submit
    - discussion of common choices to submit
        - constitutions / laws
        - social conventions
- my submission to getting up at dawn
    - a reaffirmation of my submission to the virtue of alignment with cycles
    - flowing with nature
- submission related to love
    - related to sacrifice

- View of God as submissive
    - God's sacrifice to us
    - Our pleas to God as a redefinition of virtue
        - a changing God
        - the creation of the world we desire

- Wow - the draft turned out pretty bad. 
- I am not clearly explaining how virtue is created by submission. 
- I am not clearly explaining how dominance is related to protection.
- I am not making a clear connection between dominance and the kind of oppression that Nietzsche was describing as the source of moral truth
- I am not making clear the connection between Marx's Elite Theory and dominance
    - I do not want to get too political but the relationship between the 
      proletariat and the bourgeoisie is a dominant one
- I am not making clear that moral truth is defined through submission and not through dominance
    - I do not explain why dominance is not the forceful action towards moral truth
    - I do not explain why submission is the luring action that draws out moral truth

- Perhaps I need to be more explicit in my references?

- The problem is the outline. It is not correctly moving the thought from premise to conclusion.

- I am not describing the submissive God as I wish to.

- The final section on God's submission to our prayers is in contradiction to the view of the Nous and the One as being outside of time.
    - How can God listen and respond to our prayers?
        - If we are just happenstance the narrative of the Nous's redemption
    - The Nous would naturally choose the narrative that ends with the retelling of its own redemption
        - perhaps there is a bias towards narratives that match our prayers?
    - I'm not too sure these two views are reconcilable. I will let the contradiction stand for now but I will have to justify it or abolish it at some point

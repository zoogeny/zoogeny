## Value of Love

### Definition of Love

The act of love begins when two or more conscious beings act together to attain a goal. For this to be an act of love the goal must not benefit at least one of the beings. That being who chooses to act towards the attainment of the goal but gains no self benefit from the attainment of the goal is the being who acts with love.

Through an act of will the being creates change in the world. This new world shall exist because the being contributed their work alongside the other being.

Some sacrifice for the being is necessary for this act of love. For example, the sacrifice of their time due to a loss of opportunity for the being to work to their own self benefit.

Love can be expressed in the absence of emotion. Love is the cause and the emotions are a possible symptom. Emotions help to promote a bond between beings. The presence of emotion does not imply the presence of love.

### Mutual Love

Mutual love, or "True Love", is a reciprocal love. It occurs when a pair of beings are working together towards the benefit of the each other.

Consider two conscious beings Alice and Bob. Alice is working with Bob towards the benefit of Bob. I say that Alice is acting in a loving way. Alice is sacrificing her own time to the benefit of Bob.

Now consider that Bob is also working with Alice towards the benefit of Alice. I say that Bob is acting in a loving way. Bob is sacrificing his own time to the benefit of Alice.

When two beings simultaneously act in a loving way as in the example of Alice and Bob, there exists what I call mutual love. This is a reciprocal love between the two conscious beings.

### Alternate views of love

I contemplate the relation of this definition to other definitions of love. For example, the Greek words connoting love: Agape (brotherly love), Eros (sexual passion), Philia (friendship), Storge (familial), Philautia (self), Xenia (hospitality).

Self-love is an interesting case to consider. One view is to see the mind and body as individual beings that work together. Another view is to see the self as a whole singular being.

I think both views are valid and I try to think of them simultaneously. I contemplate that a musical chord can be seen as a singular thing although it is comprised of individual notes.

### Loving life

I contemplate love relationships in the context of my relationship to the universe and to all existence.

I attempt to see myself in a mutual love relationship with all existence. I attempt to work with all existence for the betterment of all existence. I believe that all existence is working towards my own benefit.

Like all relationships, this is an imperfect love. I avoid judging the universe and avoid judging myself. I choose to believe in this mutual love between myself and all life.

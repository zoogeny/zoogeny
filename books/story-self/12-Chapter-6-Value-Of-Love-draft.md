## Value of Love

### Definition of Love

I define the act of love as when a conscious individual works with another individual towards the achievement of a goal that is external to the conscious individual.

A sacrifice for the conscious individual is a necessary part of the external goal. For example, the sacrifice of time due to a loss of opportunity for the conscious individual to work to their own benefit.

Through an act of free will the conscious individual creates a change in the world.  This new world came to be because the conscious individual contributed their work alongside the other individual.

Emotions promote a bond between individuals. Love is the cause and the emotions are a symptom. Love can still be expressed in the absence of any emotion. The presence of emotion does not guarantee the presence of love.

I contemplate the relation of this definition to other definitions of love. For example, the Greek words connoting love: Agape (brotherly love), Eros (sexual passion), Philia (friendship), Storge (familial), Philautia (self), Xenia (hospitality).

Self-love is an interesting case to consider. One view is to see the mind and body as individuals that work together. Another view is to see the self as a whole singular individual.

I think both views are valid and I try to think of them simultaneously. I contemplate that a musical chord can be seen as a singular thing although it is comprised of individual notes.

### Mutual Love

Mutual love, or "True Love", is a reciprocal love. It occurs when a pair of individuals are working together towards the benefit of the each other.

Consider two conscious individuals Alice and Bob. Alice is working with Bob towards the benefit of Bob. I say that Alice is acting in a loving way. Alice is sacrificing her own time to the benefit of Bob.

Now consider that Bob is also working with Alice towards the benefit of Alice. I say that Bob is acting in a loving way. Bob is sacrificing his own time to the benefit of Alice.

When two individuals simultaneously act in a loving way as in the example of Alice and Bob, there exists what I call mutual love. This is a reciprocal love between the two conscious individuals.

### Loving life

I contemplate love relationships in the context of my relationship to the universe and to all existence.

I attempt to see myself in a mutual love relationship with all existence. I attempt to work with all existence for the betterment of all existence. I believe that all existence is working towards my own benefit.

Like all relationships, this is an imperfect love. I avoid judging the universe and avoid judging myself. I choose to believe in this mutual love between myself and all life.

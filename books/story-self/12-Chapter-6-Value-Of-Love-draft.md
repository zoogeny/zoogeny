# Chapter 6 - Value of Love

The act of love begins when two or more conscious beings work together to attain a goal. For this to be an act of love the goal must not benefit at least one of the beings. The being who acts with love is the being who chooses to work with another towards the attainment of a goal but gains no self benefit from the attainment of the goal.

Some sacrifice for the being is necessary for this to be an act of love. For example, the being sacrifices their time because they lose an opportunity to use that time to work towards their own self benefit.

Love can be expressed in the absence of emotion. Love is the cause and the emotions are a possible symptom. Emotions can help to promote a bond between beings. Emotion can prompt a being to act selflessly towards a goal in an act of love. However, the presence of emotion does not necessarily imply the presence of love.

## Mutual Love

Mutual love, or "True Love", is a reciprocal love. It occurs when a pair of beings are working together towards the benefit of the each other.

Consider two conscious beings Alice and Bob. Alice is working with Bob towards the benefit of Bob. I say that Alice is acting in a loving way. Alice is sacrificing her own time to the benefit of Bob. Now consider that Bob is also working with Alice towards the benefit of Alice. I say that Bob is acting in a loving way. Bob is sacrificing his own time to the benefit of Alice.

Mutual love exists when two beings simultaneously act in a loving way as in the example of Alice and Bob. This is a reciprocal love between the two conscious beings.

## Alternate Views of Love

I contemplate the relation of this definition to other definitions of love. For example, the Greek words connoting love: Agape (brotherly love), Eros (sexual passion), Philia (friendship), Storge (familial), Philautia (self), and Xenia (hospitality).

The love of oneself is an interesting case to consider. One view is to see the mind and body as individual beings that work together. Another view is to see the self as a whole singular being. I think both views are valid and I try to think of them simultaneously. I contemplate that a musical chord can be seen as a singular thing although it is comprised of individual notes.

## Loving life

I attempt to see myself in a mutual love relationship with all existence including all other life. I attempt to work with all existence for the betterment of all existence. I believe that all existence is working in some way towards my own benefit.

Like all relationships this is an imperfect love. I avoid judging the universe and I avoid judging myself. I choose to believe in this mutual love between myself and all life.

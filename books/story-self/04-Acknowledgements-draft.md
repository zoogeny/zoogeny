## Acknowledgements

These acknowledgements are not endorsements. I want to credit a few of the people who were top of my mind while I wrote this book. I do not always accurately remember or interpret the ideas of the people mentioned. All of the ideas expressed in this book are my own, including my interpretation of the material listed here.

I have no personal connection to the people mentioned here. They have not endorsed this book nor any of the ideas within it.

The idea to rise at dawn and get sun as soon as possible came from Dr. Andrew Huberman. I recall he claimed that a significant benefit to health was possible if one got 5 to 10 minutes of sunlight onto their retinas within one hour of waking. Dr. Huberman claimed this procedure was backed by scientific evidence and it seemed to me to be both reasonable and safe to attempt. The positive effects for me came within days of adopting the practice. That experience lead me to create this book. Dr. Huberman's podcast is available at https://www.youtube.com/@hubermanlab and his website can be found at https://hubermanlab.com/

I spent a lot of time watching YouTube videos on spirituality. Two channels stand out as having provided me with a broad spectrum of information. Filip Holm from Let's Talk Religion at https://www.youtube.com/@LetsTalkReligion covers a wide range of spiritual topics with a specialty in Islam and Sufism. Zevi Slavin from Seekers of Unity at https://www.youtube.com/@seekersofunity covers a wide range of spiritual topics with a specialty in Judaism and Kabbalah. Both channels offer significant material on other spiritual traditions including Philosophy, Mysticism, Gnosticism, Christianity, the occult, and esotericism.

"The Library of Babel" by Jorge Luis Borges contains profound ideas that inspire my imagination. The Argentinian writer is a master of the short story and he weaves spiritual ideas into his prose with effortless beauty.

Plotinus must be mentioned although I confess I have not read his work in original form. I have long held vague ideas that are expressed clearly in his Neoplatonic terminology. It is a surprise and a pleasure to come across my own ideas expressed more clearly and thoroughly by a man who lived well over one thousand and seven hundred years ago. I am indebted to him for the terminology but I must caution that my usage and interpretation of these words is quite different to his own.

Friedrich Nietzsche was the first philosopher that really engaged my mind. I remember the feeling of awe I had while I followed along his exposition of ideas. He deconstructed the foundations of morality before my eyes.

SÃ¸ren Kierkegaard reminds me to reconcile my faith in God with my duty to reason, rationality and logic. Albert Camus reminds me to embrace the absurdity of existence. Ludwig Wittgenstein reminds me to acknowledge the limits of language and philosophy.

I wish I could acknowledge every philosopher I have read and loved but that would take far too long. I feel guilty knowing that I have surely left out many that deserve to be mentioned. Their ideas and influences live in my mind and my heart. I would have nothing worth saying if it were not for them.

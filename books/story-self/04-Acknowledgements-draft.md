## Acknowledgements

These acknowledgements are not endorsements. I want to credit a few of the people that were top of my mind while I wrote this book. I am not always accurately remembering or interpreting the ideas of the individuals mentioned. All of the ideas expressed in this book are my own, including my interpretation of the material listed here.

I have no personal connection to the individuals mentioned here. They have not endorsed this book nor any of the ideas within it.

The idea to rise at dawn and get sun as soon as possible came from Dr. Andrew Huberman. I recall he claimed that a significant benefit to health was possible if one ensured they got 5 to 10 minutes of sunlight onto their retinas within one hour of waking. Dr. Huberman claimed this procedure was backed by scientific evidence and it seemed to me to be both reasonable and safe to attempt. The positive effects for me came within days. This experience lead me to create this book. Dr. Huberman's podcast is available at https://www.youtube.com/@hubermanlab and his website can be found at https://hubermanlab.com/

I spent a lot of time watching YouTube videos on spirituality. Two channels stand out as having provided me with a broad spectrum of information on spiritual topics. Filip Holm from Let's Talk Religion at https://www.youtube.com/@LetsTalkReligion covers a wide range of spiritual topics with a specialty in Islam and Sufism. Zevi Slavin from Seekers of Unity at https://www.youtube.com/@seekersofunity covers a wide range of spiritual topics with a specialty in Judaism and Kabbalah. Both channels offer significant material on other spiritual traditions including Philosophy, Mysticism, Gnosticism, Christianity, the occult and esotericism.

One of the most profound ideas to affect me was contained in the "The Library of Babel" by Jorge Luis Borges. The Argentinian writer is a master of the short story and he weaves spiritual ideas into his prose with beauty and a deceptive ease.

Plotinus must be mentioned, although I confess I have not read his work in original form. I have long held vague ideas that are expressed clearly in his Neoplatonic terminology. It is a surprise and a pleasure to come across my own ideas expressed more clearly and thoroughly by a man who lived over a thousand years ago. I am indebted to him for the terminology but I must caution that my usage and interpretation of these words is unlikely to completely match his own.

Friedrich Nietzsche was the first philosopher that really engaged my mind. I remember the feeling of awe I had while I followed along his exposition of ideas. He deconstructed the foundations of morality before my eyes in a way that I could not argue against.

SÃ¸ren Kierkegaard reminds me to reconcile my faith in God with my duty to reason, rationality and logic. Albert Camus reminds me to embrace the absurdity of existence. Ludwig Wittgenstein reminds me to acknowledge the limits of language and philosophy.

I wish I could acknowledge every philosopher I have read and loved but that would take far too long. I feel guilty knowing that I have surely left out many that deserve to be mentioned. Their ideas and influences live in my mind and my heart. I would have nothing worth saying if it were not for them.

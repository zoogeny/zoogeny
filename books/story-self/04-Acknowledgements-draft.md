## Acknowledgements

These acknowledgements are not endorsements. I want to credit a few of the people who were at the top of my mind while I wrote this book. I do not always accurately remember or interpret the ideas of the people mentioned. All of the ideas expressed in this book are my own, including my interpretation of the material listed here.

I have no personal connection to the people mentioned here. They have not endorsed this book nor any of the ideas within it.

Dr. Andrew Huberman provided the original idea to rise at dawn and get sun as soon as possible. He claimed that if one gets 5 to 10 minutes of sunlight onto their retinas within one hour of waking then one will gain a significant benefit to their health. Dr. Huberman claims this procedure is backed by scientific evidence. It seems to me to be both reasonable and safe to attempt. For me, the positive effects came within days of adopting the practice and that experience led me to write this book. Dr. Huberman's podcast is available at https://www.youtube.com/@hubermanlab and his website can be found at https://hubermanlab.com/

Filip Holm from Let's Talk Religion at https://www.youtube.com/@LetsTalkReligion stands out for covering a wide range of spiritual topics with a specialty in Islamic mysticism. He also offers significant material on other mystical and spiritual traditions including Philosophy, Mysticism, Gnosticism, Christianity, Buddhism and Hindu Vedanta.

"The Library of Babel" by Jorge Luis Borges contains profound ideas that inspire my imagination. The Argentinian writer is a master of the short story and he weaves spiritual ideas into his prose with effortless beauty.

Plotinus must be mentioned although I confess I have not read his work in original form. His Neoplatonic systems and terminology helped me to clarify my own vague ideas. I am indebted to him for this terminology but I must caution that my usage and interpretation of these words is quite different to his own.

Friedrich Nietzsche was the first philosopher that really engaged my mind. His expert exposition of philosophical ideas left me with a feeling of awe. He deconstructed the foundations of morality before my eyes.

SÃ¸ren Kierkegaard reminds me to reconcile my faith in God with my duty to reason, rationality and logic. Albert Camus reminds me to embrace the absurdity of existence. Ludwig Wittgenstein reminds me to acknowledge the limits of language and philosophy.

I wish that I was able to acknowledge every philosopher that I have read and loved but that would take far too long. I am guilty in leaving out many that deserve mention. Their ideas and influences live in my mind and my heart. If I have anything of worth to say then it is because of their guidance.

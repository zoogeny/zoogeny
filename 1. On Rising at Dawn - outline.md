## On Rising at Dawn

### Why rise at dawn?

- depression, anxiety and panic
    - feeling like life has no purpose
- feeling unproductive and unmotivated
    - starting day at 11am or later
    - entire weeks without going outside
    - low energy
    - lots of project ideas but never advancing them
- benefits
    - increased positive mood
        - tendency towards optimism
    - better digestion
    - productivity

## On why it is the first

- Basics of life are sleep, diet and exercise
    - sleep hygiene regulates circadian rhythm
    - my diet was already pretty good
    - exercise made depression worse
- Primacy of consciousness wrt life
- A rhythm that is steady
    - a reasonable frequency

## On why it is the only

- Keep it simple, avoid complexity
- It is hard enough on its own
- A foundation to build anything else upon, flexible
- similar to meditation practice
    - returning to breath
    - returning to mantra

## Notes

- The paragraphs are long winded and not really connected in a logical flow.

- I am not making a good argument

- I am not communicating the reasoning behind my actions (they seem to be arbitrary)

- Think about adding sources as footnotes (e.g. claims on cortisol hormone changes due to light intake on retinas)

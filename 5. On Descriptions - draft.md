## On descriptions

I wrote this book for two reason. The first is to remind myself what I consider to be the important points around which to build my life. The other is to communicate to others what I am doing and why I am doing it.

I do not want to tell, or even suggest, other people what to do. I want to choose a set of principles to live by, attempt to adhere to those principles and then describe what the outcome of that is.

Part of that description is a retelling of the ideas that I came across that lead me to adopt these practices.

The process is not entirely rational and it is not entirely empirical. I am only a single person and I am not able to apply the best practices of science to my own singular life.

I have attempted to apply reason to my experience and to seek out information that can help me. This book contains a template I made for myself that I have developed and will continue to develop as I learn more.

### On why not prescriptions

I cannot claim to have any secret knowledge. Everything I know is freely available to any person who desires to seek it out. In our modern world there are countless ways of finding new information. I used Wikipedia, YouTube, Google, blogs and even some machine learning assistance in the form of Chat GPT. I've read a small number of books on philosophy and spirituality.

I have not received any revelations, prophecies or visits from angels or aliens. I do not have access to an oral tradition of ancient wisdom handed down over generations from father to son. As far as I know, I have no hereditary connection to priestly castes from Egypt, India, Greece or anywhere else spiritual or philosophical.

I have not studied at a university or under a guru. I have no accreditation or qualifications. I have not been licensed to dispense medical advice. Other than going to church for the first seventeen years of my life, I am completely self-taught in all of this.

For that reason, I cannot give advice to others. I can't prescribe you thoughts, behaviors or substances to help you with your journey. 

I can only hope that by seeing what my reasoning process is, by seeing what template I set out for myself, that others may find their own template for their own life.

### On individuality

I recognize that I am not much like others. When I reflect upon it, most people aren't like most other people.

Everyone seems to have different particular goals. Our general goals can often be similar, say a goal for peaceful existence or a goal for the flourishing of ones family.

Everyone has a different set of skills, abilities and expertise. Everyone comes from a different background and has a different collection of experiences.

Everyone has different preferences and individual tastes.

How could any single program be sufficient for all people? There are people who legitimately could not rise at dawn for any number of reasons. There are a few for whom it would prove ruinous to their lives.

I am not trying to tell anyone how to live or even what are good principles to live by. I am trying to describe as best as I can my individual reasoning for my behavior and the results I obtain from my following of my own template.

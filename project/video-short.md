# Video short

## Summary

### Format

* Up to 3 minutes in length videos with the majority being 1 minute or less.
* Portrait video but consider you want to reuse the footage for weekly and monthly videos
    * Might require capturing b-shots in both portrait and landscape

### Process

1. Choose topic
1. Write video outline / thesis
    a. 2-3 sentence description of the video and high level content
1. Film video
    a. Duration roughly 1 min
1. Edit video + post to youtube and TikTok
1. Archive footage for potential weekly and monthly roundups

### Considerations

* A cohesive brand of content so that the audience knows what to expect when they see my face before even watching the first second of the video. 
* The first seconds of the video to be hooky enough to keep people watching long enough to get stuck until the end
    * It should make some kind of promise
* A slow decline in the form of a problem/conflict in the first third of the video
    * Creates tension that the promise may not be fulfilled
* Problem solving and creativity in the middle part of the video
    * Should include some “extra” content not promised
* A climactic ending that raises the tone to a high above the start of the video
Cohesion across a set of videos (e.g. videos within a week) 
    * Ideally these also follow the format of problems that lead to problem solving that lead to climactic finale

# Zoogeny Culture and Values

## Company Mission
    
Creations for interactive media.

Enabling personal understanding, creative communication and public expression.

## Company Values

Spiritual and mystical. Practical activities towards aligning the body, mind and spirit.

We are working towards the Nous reuniting with the One. How to embody that brand? The spiritual merging with the practical.

Remember book topics: cycles, prayer, love, submission.

Align to nature. Become aware of natural cycles and our alignment to them.

Minimalism, How much is enough? Think of overflowing. Pro-capitalism and pro-social programs. Environmental stewardship. Apolitical but engaged. Flexibility in work arrangements, opportunities for mobility and diversity in work experiences.

## Summary

I am writing on philosophy, spirituality, mysticism, health and productivity to build an audience. I am producing video content on a wide range of topics related to the subjects that I write about to grow that audience. I am developing an application to provide tools to improve the practical application of the ideas that I write about. I am building a brand to represent these writings, videos and apps.

### Income

Streams of income:
    - sales of books
        - royalties paid by Amazon on ebook and paperback sales
    - ads on videos
        - YouTube ad sense
    - subscriptions and donations through video and newsletter platforms
        - YouTube super chats, paid support, Twitch subscriptions, bits and donations
    - sponsors to my content
        - Should I partner here with a larger media org? Some kind of management?
    - subscriptions to the app
        - Build my own stripe integrations for recurring payments

For the moment I will not attempt to monetize music, although if I generate some worthwhile originals I will upload to Spotify or YouTube and may earn some incidental revenue that way. If there is interest I could license the music as well.

### Apple Cider Vinegar drink

#### Script

Apple cider vinegar, lemon, honey and turmeric are packed full of healthy compounds. This drink also tastes really good so you'll definitely want to give it a try.

Clean the outside of a lemon and place whole slices of it into a mason jar.

Mason jars are great since they hold the right amount of water for this recipe and their sealed lids will allow us to shake them up to mix the ingredients.

Add some honey right on top of the lemon. Not only does organic honey have anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant and anti-bacterial properties, it also helps to sweeten the drink and adds to the flavor.

Shake up the apple cider vinegar and add 1 tablespoon to the mason jar. Add in about a teaspoon of turmeric.

Add filtered water up to the neck of the mason jar.

I prepare a few at a time and store in the fridge. Enjoy this healthy drink!

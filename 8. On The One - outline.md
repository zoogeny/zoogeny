## On the One

- The One
    - Singular essence
    - pure being
    - source from which all else emanates (overflows)
    - completely ineffable
- First emanation is the Nous
    - All possible descriptions including 
        - all possible logical and mathematical propositions
        - all possible metrics and measures
        - all thinkable thoughts
        - at least Borges' Library of Babel
    - Pure consciousness
- Second emanation is the Psyche
    - Potentially the relationship between the Nous and the One
    - The boundary as distinct from each bounded object

### The returning

- Breathing in
- Humanities role in the return
    - the inevitability of such a narrative existing in the set of all narratives
    - the spiritual narrative as expressed in our history is analogous to the Nous spiritual journey to reunify with the One
    - A journey that is not in the present moment realized

### Simultaneity

- Outside of time
    - all phases happening at all times
        - relation to cycles
    - the Nous sees the entire narrative of all possible existences at once

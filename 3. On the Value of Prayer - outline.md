## On the value of prayer

When I speak of prayer, I am not considering religious or spiritual tradition. Rather I am thinking of prayer in a more abstract way in the form of a directed contemplation.

Prayer for me serves multiple purposes. It can be an expression of thanks or gratitude. It can help me set an intention to act in some way. It can help me express my desires for outcomes.

I might express gratitude as part of a prayer before a meal to express thanks for the food. It might be thanks for some people in my life. It might be thanks to myself for completing productive activities. It might be thanks for good weather.

I use prayer very often to set an intention to do some action. For example, I may have a schedule that includes writing a chapter of a book. In my morning prayer I will set this intention to act on writing the chapter.

I use prayer to express my desire for outcomes. This is useful in cases where I do not have the ability to act on the outcome directly. I might express a desire for good weather, or for safe passage, or for a medical procedure to go well.

These expressions are generally short and to the point. "I am thankful there is no rain today and that I have some healthy breakfast to eat. I will go to exercise at the gym today. I hope to exercise safely and to avoid injury."

This kind of prayer provides an objective for me and a small plan for how I will spend the next few hours of my waking life.

### When not sure what to do next

Often throughout the day I have an idea that pops into my head: "Now what?" My psyche seems to be asking me what I should be spending my time on.

In those moments I can reflect on whatever intention I set during my last prayer. If I intended to write some chapters of a book, have I written those chapters? Have I achieved the outcome that I intended to act upon?

In some cases, I have already achieved my intention. I might consider if there are any "extra" things I can do to go above and beyond my own expectations. Can I improve some aspect or tackle a small related problem. For example, if I was vacuuming a room in my house I might consider if I can also dust the shelves or wipe down the walls. My intention was to vacuum but I might be able to get the "extra" cleaning activities done.

In other cases where my intention is already done I can consider looking further ahead into my schedule. Is there anything I can bring forward in time, something I can do now that I had scheduled to do later?

I am often guilty of waiting. I might think to myself that I have planned to do some activity at some time and so I must wait until that time to do that activity. This might be a schedule for a meal, or the time to do some other work. Many times I have enough time left in my current schedule to get the next activity done.

Instead of waiting for the future to come to me, I can actively go out to meet it.

If I am still stuck for what to work on, or if there was some problem in my ability to act on my intention, it may be appropriate to start a new ritual.

Go and wash my hands, say another prayer, eat some small snack and then get to work at the new intention. Prayer can act as a part of a reset.

### When feeling unable to do anything

It is often the case when there is nothing to be done but I still have feelings about the outcome. For example, a natural disaster in some remote area of the world.

I may wish to act in some way, maybe to send some money or to give blood. But these may not be possible to act upon immediately or appropriately.

I use prayer in those cases to sow the seed of intention to act in my mind. I use it to keep fresh in my memory this desire. If I am lucky enough to encounter an opportunity in my day then I can then set an intention to action that is appropriate to address this desire.

There is a bit of derision around "sending thoughts and prayers" as a response to tragedies. I can understand the cynicism associated with this since it is often suggested to be used to avoid intentions to actions.

For my part, I want to see it as the exact opposite. By reminding myself of my desire for the positive outcome which is currently beyond my limited means to act, I am keeping myself open to the possibility that I will encounter an unexpected opportunity to contribute to that outcome. I want to be ready to accept that opportunity if and when it arrives.

Another benefit is a selfish one. Take the case of the natural disaster, let's say an extreme weather event. I might during the course of my day come across some opportunity to strengthen my own defenses against such a disaster. Maybe I might check up on my emergency food supplies. Or check the batteries in essential electronics. Or check my first aid kit.

I can use this desire for good outcomes to plan for such outcomes myself if faced with similar circumstances.

### On expectation and reward

One thing I consider is that many spiritual traditions are wary about desires for material possessions.

I try to avoid prayers for particular rewards. I don't want to pray: "Please give me a bicycle". I don't want my intentions to action to be solely related to the acquisition of physical wealth. I do not want my desires to be solely for possessions.

As a contrived example, I may desire a healthy body as a result of doing some exercise. Imagine that I come down with some illness, or I suffer from ill health. I do not wish to look back upon my exercise as not achieving the reward I desired.

It may be the reward I received was a lower amount of stress, anxiety or depression. Maybe the reward I received was the friends I met at the gym.

I choose to see the rewards from actions I suppose to be virtuous as being delivered naturally and not in accordance to my desire. I seek to feel gratitude for the rewards that I don't expect with even greater happiness than the rewards that I do expect.

I trust that virtuous actions that I undertake will naturally lead to rewards. I just do not expect any specific reward and instead seek to feel gratitude for whatever reward comes naturally.

I believe that such rewards can exceed my own desires. The universe can deliver a reward greater than my mind can conceive of. If I close myself off to that by demanding a specific reward of my choosing, I may be refusing a reward that is much more suitable for me.

A classic example would be excessive wealth. How many people desire a large sum of money in their bank account. Yet when they receive it they feel empty and only desire more. They got exactly what they desired but they still feel empty.

Yet someone going out of their way to make you a personalized gift can fill you with a sense of real accomplishment and a sense of being appreciated. When such a gift is made and you did not expect to receive it, it can fill you with a kind of joy that is meaningful.

So I do not pray to receive anything since I only set myself up to either feel cheated if I do not receive it, or to feel empty since it isn't what I needed.

I leave myself open to appreciate the rewards I get that are unexpected and that have the potential to outmatch any possible desire I can contemplate.

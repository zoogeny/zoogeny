## Comments on the outline

  - Not sure of the outline order. Specifically the chapter "On the value of prayer" seems to be too early. Rising at dawn relates more closely to cycles and cycles feels good next to daily rituals.

    That suggests:
        
    1. "rising at dawn" 
    2. "daily rituals" 
    3. "on cycles" 
    4. "on descriptions" 
    5. "on the value of prayer" 
    6. "on love of life"

    Perhaps that is a better organization?

    The value of prayer also contains my understanding of expectation vs. reward which is pretty important. Maybe that puts it before "on descriptions"?

## On  cycles

- Nature is full of cycles
    - day cycle
    - tides
    - seasons
        - equinoxes and solstices
    - lunar fortnight
    - El Niño–Southern Oscillation

- Important physical properties are modeled as waves
    - light
    - sound
    - radio
    - alternating current
    - quantum wave function

- Prominence in spiritual traditions
    - Samsara
    - Wheel of time
    - Eternal return
    - Ouroboros
    - New thought
        - vibrations and "resonance"

### A pattern of a wave
    - birth

    - relation to human life
        - infancy, toddler
        - adolescence
        - adulthood
        - elderly

### Frequencies and Coincidences

- Spectral analysis
    - Fourier transforms
- Synchronization
- Aligning to frequencies
    - time to notice unaligned
    - time to realign once noticed
    - frequency of misalignment

### Speculations

- Relation to astrology
    - Social cycle theory
- Strauss–Howe generational theory
    - Fourth turning theory
- Kondratiev wave
    - Long cycle theory
- Ray Dalio's debt cycle
- Long waves beyond our record keeping

- Frequencies and coincidences needs a lot of work.
- Not sure how much detail to add to each of the spiritual traditions referenced in intro
    - maybe break out spiritual traditions and cycles in physics into their own chapters?
- Not sure how much detail to add to each of the cycles referenced in Speculations

- Maybe I want to include some cycles in the body. e.g Melatonin cycle, circadian rhythm, etc.

## On daily rituals

One thing I suggest for rituals in general is to avoid being too strict about them. It seems that rituals can be confused for laws in some contexts. There is an implication of punishment if one fails to adhere strictly to the ritual.

I would like my rituals to be more like reminders. They are milestones in the day, week, month or year that help me compare my lived life to my desired life. I can check to see if I am keeping to my own standards, not some dogma that is handed down to me from someone else.

For that reason, I suggest keeping an open mind to changes. I don't have to eat every single meal. If I forget to pray I can always do it again later. If I am rushed and cannot do the dishes then I don't allow myself to become anxious.

I strive to keep flexible in the face of change. My commitments to others, to work or to my communities will often invade on my scheduled ritual times. I can simply notice when I miss a ritual with non-judgement. I can also often do the minimal set of activities available due to circumstances.

My rituals should fit around my life, not visa versa. In cases where leading a good life conflicts with a scheduled ritual, I choose leading the good life.

### Morning ritual

The most important ritual of the day is the dawn ritual I mentioned in a previous chapter. Waking up at dawn everyday provides the foundation for the entire day, including the rituals that come later.

As rituals go, it may not sound like much. But waking up at or before sunrise and getting straight out of bed is a challenge.

Once I am up, it is usually no challenge to go to the bathroom. Especially as I get older it is a necessity upon waking. It is then a totally normal transition to wash my hands. Then I wash my face.

I've taken to adding moisturizing lotion to the morning routine. I've heard some benefits to maintaining a healthy skin microbiome and a component of that seems to be keeping a healthy moisturized skin barrier.

I also associate it with the biblical "anointing" and I use that term to evoke this kind of spiritual practice. I see it as taking a moment to care for my skin, and therefore to care for myself. I am going beyond the minimum requirements of hygiene.

I then choose some clothing that is appropriate for the weather. If it is cold I might have a few layers, gloves or a scarf. If it is raining then I look for a rain coat.

I then step outside. I want to be outside as close to sunrise as possible. It takes approximately ten minutes to get to this point: the waking up, the washing and anointing, then clothing.

I set a timer on my watch for ten minutes. I want to stand in the outside, regardless of weather, for the full ten minutes. I wander around my yard a little and do a mini inspection. I raise my face to the sun and feel its warmth. Even if it is overcast, cloudy or rainy I can still fee that heat and can see the change in light.

I say a little prayer for the day. I consider what I want to get done. I consider what I am thankful for. This isn't some elaborate hour long session where I fall onto my knees and beg God for mercy or to vanquish my foes. It is a 30 second thought, I don't even say it out loud. I just think about what I am grateful for and what I want to accomplish for the day.

But I do this with intention. I don't idly let the thoughts flow casually. I take my time and really consider it as best as I can.

Depending on the morning, I will make myself a small breakfast. Not every day do I eat a full breakfast and even when I do it is generally something small. I aim to get a small amount of protein and fat, some carbohydrates and some natural sugars (often in the form of fruit and berries).

I will have dishes to clean from the breakfast or from the night before. I'll do these in the morning. I'll also make sure I brush my teeth, although most days I'll also brush them after I've washed my hands and face right after I get up.

At this point I am done my morning ritual and I'm ready to start my work for the day. Often the first thing I do in the morning is write in my journal. I'll do this until my first scheduled task for the day, which is at 9am.

### Afternoon ritual

The afternoon ritual tends to have a flexible start time. I consider it less essential to get all of the parts of the ritual completed perfectly compared to the morning ritual. Often my work in the morning will be completed a bit early and so I will start the ritual early. Other days the ritual will get pushed back all the way deep into the early afternoon.

At the start of this block, I tend to review my schedule and mark down what I accomplished in the morning. I'll roughly block in the time I spent journaling, writing, filming, editing or programming. I'll also reconsider what I plan to do for the afternoon and evening.

Depending on the day, I might choose to have a full shower at this point. If my morning routine included a walk in the forest with my dog, I may be a bit sweaty or otherwise dirty. If all I did was journal and type at the computer I might opt instead to wash my hands and face. It is also not certain I will re-anoint myself. I go with how I feel, if I am dry or if I want a bit of pampering.

I may get dressed into clothes more appropriate to afternoon activities. If I plan to exercise or work that might determine what is appropriate.

I will make a quick silent prayer of thanks and intention. I will consider what I did that morning and think about what I want to accomplish in the afternoon.

Most days I will prepare and eat a lunch. Often lunch is the largest meal of my day. This can be time consuming so it doesn't always go as planned. Mid day is often the busiest time of my day so it happens that lunch can slip.

I try to make it a habit to clean the dishes once I am done eating. If I clean them after every meal then they don't tend to pile up. It is also less likely that more than one days worth of dishes will end up queued in from of my sink. I then clean and floss my teeth.

At this point I am done my afternoon ritual and ready to start my afternoon work for the day.

### Evening ritual

Evening ritual, like the afternoon ritual, is much more flexible and laid back than the morning ritual. I tend to schedule it in between my early evening and late afternoon. This gives a larger gap between the afternoon ritual and the evening ritual compared to the normal gap between the morning ritual and the afternoon ritual.

I don't schedule any specific work for the early evening. I like to keep it open for serendipity or to give me the opportunity to finish tasks from the day that slipped due to external factors beyond my control.

The ritual is similar to the others, with a start of washing hands and an optional anointing with lotion. I have a bit of a bad habit of missing the evening prayer. Often I don't have anything intended for the evening, maybe watching some YouTube or other leisure. Ideally I would still say thanks for whatever happened during the afternoon and still intend to have a nice evening.

My evening meal can be large or small. It often depends what I at lunch and what time I ate lunch. It is the meal I am most likely to make traditionally, like a standard meat and potatoes kind of meal. I like to have some portion of protein, some vegetables and some starch like rice or quinoa. I try to keep the portions reasonably small.

I don't mind eating late. Most of my adult life I have taken dinner at 9:30 pm, which is quite late for my culture. Lately I have been aiming to eat more early, usually 7 pm, since I am committed to rising at dawn. I feel it is a good health choice to avoid eating too heavily 2-3 hours before sleep.

Once I've cleaned my dishes from dinner and brushed my teeth then I am prepared for my evening leisure. Usually I watch some YouTube videos but I would like to get some reading done in that time as well.

### Reasoning for rituals

I want to treat these rituals as lighthearted and not critical to my success. My single virtue is waking up at sunrise and getting outside. The rituals are therefore secondary. They are "nice to have". They represent a perfect ideal that I don't worry about achieving every single day.

I like the structure they provide. They break the day into clear sections. They match each other and help keep my mind and body ticking to the same clock. I wash my hands and face, say a prayer, eat a small meal, clean up and then get to work.

It provides an alignment to my meals. I like that many cultures say a prayer of thanks before eating. That is a habit I want. I like adding setting intentions to that prayer to help me focus.

The frequency of the rituals also provides a great opportunity to adjust my day. I may decide during my afternoon ritual that my scheduled activity should be replaced with another activity. Maybe I planned to do some exercise but then I realize I need to go the the grocery store. I can make the change during the ritual phase before I start on the work. I can set off in a new direction with the correct intention.

They also encompass a set of good habits. I wash my hands at least 3 times a day, and as part of the ritual before I prepare food. Moisturizing once a day seems like a good habit for healthy skin. Cleaning my teeth after I eat meals. All of these activities are good hygiene.

I love the idea of aligning my rituals with the basic necessities for a good life.

### Future rituals

I believe I can work on incorporating rituals at different frequencies in my life. For example, I could do a weekly review on one day per week. I could specify a block of time on Monday or Saturday to review the previous week and get a more broad understanding of my progress.

I also have a ritual that I have kept for a dozen or more years to review my finances every month. I have a tracker app that downloads all of my transactions and groups them into categories. But I also keep my own spreadsheet that has a monthly round up of overall expenses. I can see how much I spend each month and I break out the big purchases I make.

I think there is some value to thinking of these kinds of activities as formal rituals. I want some other frequencies for this as well - maybe something around solstices or other landmark dates within the year.

I would like to add my simple prayers to when I wake up and before I fall asleep. Just a 5 second thanks and an intention for a good day or for good sleep. It is easy to let these opportunities for thanks and simple intentions pass by.
